        are starting to allow us to probe the\n        physical processes in the evolution
        of very massive stars\n        through the imprints they leave on their final
        remnants. Stellar\n        evolution theory predicts the existence of a gap
        in the black\n        hole mass distribution at high mass due to the effects
        of pair\n        instability. Previously, we showed that the location of the
        gap\n        is robust against model uncertainties, but it does depend\n        sensitively
        on the uncertain ${}^{12}{\\rm{C}}{(\\alpha ,\\gamma\n        )}^{16}{\\rm{O}}$
        rate. This rate is of great astrophysical\n        significance and governs
        the production of oxygen at the expense\n        of carbon. We use the open-source
        MESA stellar evolution code to\n        evolve massive helium stars to probe
        the location of the mass\n        gap. We find that the maximum black hole
        mass below the gap\n        varies between $40\\,{M}_{\\odot }$ and $90\\,{M}_{\\odot
        }$ ,\n        depending on the strength of the uncertain\n        ${}^{12}{\\rm{C}}{(\\alpha
        ,\\gamma )}^{16}{\\rm{O}}$ reaction rate.\n        With the first 10 gravitational-wave
        detections of black holes,\n        we constrain the astrophysical S-factor
        for\n        ${}^{12}{\\rm{C}}{(\\alpha ,\\gamma )}^{16}{\\rm{O}}$ , at\n        $300\\,\\mathrm{keV}$
        , to ${S}_{300} 175\\,\\,{\\rm{keV}}\\,{\\rm{b}}$\n        at 68\\% confidence.
        With ${ \\mathcal O }(50)$ detected binary\n        black hole mergers, we
        expect to constrain the S-factor to\n        within {\\ensuremath{\\pm}}10-30
        ${\\rm{keV}}\\,{\\rm{b}}$ . We also\n        highlight a role for independent
        constraints from\n        electromagnetic transient surveys. The unambiguous
        detection of\n        pulsational pair-instability supernovae would imply
        that\n        ${S}_{300} 79\\,{\\rm{keV}}\\,{\\rm{b}}$ . Degeneracies with
        other\n        model uncertainties need to be investigated further, but probing\n        nuclear
        stellar astrophysics poses a promising science case for\n        the future
        gravitational-wave detectors.}\",\n          doi = {10.3847/2041-8213/abbadd},\narchivePrefix

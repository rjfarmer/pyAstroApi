        Gravitational-wave detections are starting to allow us to probe the physical
        processes in the evolution of very massive stars through the imprints they
        leave on their final remnants. Stellar evolution theory predicts the existence
        of a gap in the black hole mass distribution at high mass due to the effects
        of pair instability. Previously, we showed that the location of the gap is
        robust against model uncertainties, but it does depend sensitively on the
        uncertain ${}^{12}{\\rm{C}}{(\\alpha ,\\gamma )}^{16}{\\rm{O}}$ rate. This
        rate is of great astrophysical significance and governs the production of
        oxygen at the expense of carbon. We use the open-source MESA stellar evolution
        code to evolve massive helium stars to probe the location of the mass gap.
        We find that the maximum black hole mass below the gap varies between $40\\,{M}_{\\odot
        }$ and $90\\,{M}_{\\odot }$ , depending on the strength of the uncertain ${}^{12}{\\rm{C}}{(\\alpha
        ,\\gamma )}^{16}{\\rm{O}}$ reaction rate. With the first 10 gravitational-wave
        detections of black holes, we constrain the astrophysical S-factor for ${}^{12}{\\rm{C}}{(\\alpha
        ,\\gamma )}^{16}{\\rm{O}}$ , at $300\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ , to ${S}_{300} 175\\,\\,{\\rm{keV}}\\,{\\rm{b}}$
        at 68% confidence. With ${ \\mathcal O }(50)$ detected binary black hole mergers,
        we expect to constrain the S-factor to within \u00b110-30 ${\\rm{keV}}\\,{\\rm{b}}$
        . We also highlight a role for independent constraints from electromagnetic
        transient surveys. The unambiguous detection of pulsational pair-instability
        supernovae would imply that ${S}_{300} 79\\,{\\rm{keV}}\\,{\\rm{b}}$ . Degeneracies
        with other model uncertainties need to be investigated further, but probing
        nuclear stellar astrophysics poses a promising science case for the future
        gravitational-wave detectors.\nIS  - 0004-637X\n\n\n"}'

        detections are starting to allow us to probe the physical processes in the
        evolution of very massive stars through the imprints they leave on their final
        remnants. Stellar evolution theory predicts the existence of a gap in the
        black hole mass distribution at high mass due to the effects of pair instability.
        Previously, we showed that the location of the gap is robust against model
        uncertainties, but it does depend sensitively on the uncertain ${}^{12}{\\\\rm{C}}{(\\\\alpha
        ,\\\\gamma )}^{16}{\\\\rm{O}}$ rate. This rate is of great astrophysical significance
        and governs the production of oxygen at the expense of carbon. We use the
        open-source MESA stellar evolution code to evolve massive helium stars to
        probe the location of the mass gap. We find that the maximum black hole mass
        below the gap varies between $40\\\\,{M}_{\\\\odot }$ and $90\\\\,{M}_{\\\\odot
        }$ , depending on the strength of the uncertain ${}^{12}{\\\\rm{C}}{(\\\\alpha
        ,\\\\gamma )}^{16}{\\\\rm{O}}$ reaction rate. With the first 10 gravitational-wave
        detections of black holes, we constrain the astrophysical S-factor for ${}^{12}{\\\\rm{C}}{(\\\\alpha
        ,\\\\gamma )}^{16}{\\\\rm{O}}$ , at $300\\\\,\\\\mathrm{keV}$ , to ${S}_{300}\\\\gt
        175\\\\,\\\\,{\\\\rm{keV}}\\\\,{\\\\rm{b}}$ at 68% confidence. With ${ \\\\mathcal
        O }(50)$ detected binary black hole mergers, we expect to constrain the S-factor
        to within \xB110-30 ${\\\\rm{keV}}\\\\,{\\\\rm{b}}$ . We also highlight a
        role for independent constraints from electromagnetic transient surveys. The
        unambiguous detection of pulsational pair-instability supernovae would imply
        that ${S}_{300}\\\\gt 79\\\\,{\\\\rm{keV}}\\\\,{\\\\rm{b}}$ . Degeneracies
        with other model uncertainties need to be investigated further, but probing
        nuclear stellar astrophysics poses a promising science case for the future
        gravitational-wave detectors.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Farmer, R.\",\n          \"Renzo,

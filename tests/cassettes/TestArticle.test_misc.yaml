        cosmic origin of carbon, a fundamental building block of life, is still uncertain.
        Yield predictions for massive stars are almost exclusively based on single-star
        models, even though a large fraction interact with a binary companion. Using
        the MESA stellar evolution code, we predict the amount of carbon ejected in
        the winds and supernovae of single and binary-stripped stars at solar metallicity.
        We find that binary-stripped stars are twice as efficient at producing carbon
        (1.5-2.6 times, depending on choices regarding the slope of the initial mass
        function and black hole formation). We confirm that this is because the convective
        helium core recedes in stars that have lost their hydrogen envelope, as noted
        previously. The shrinking of the core disconnects the outermost carbon-rich
        layers created during the early phase of helium burning from the more central
        burning regions. The same effect prevents carbon destruction, even when the
        supernova shock wave passes. The yields are sensitive to the treatment of
        mixing at convective boundaries, specifically during carbon-shell burning
        (variations up to 40%), and improving upon this should be a central priority
        for more reliable yield predictions. The yields are robust (variations less
        than 0.5%) across our range of explosion assumptions. Black hole formation
        assumptions are also important, implying that the stellar graveyard now explored
        by gravitational-wave detections may yield clues to better understand the
        cosmic carbon production. Our findings also highlight the importance of accounting
        for binary-stripped stars in chemical yield predictions and motivates further
        studies of other products of binary interactions.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Farmer,

        partially or completely stripped of their outer hydrogen envelope, is a catalyst
        of the cosmic matter cycle and decisive ingredient of massive star evolution.
        Yet, its theoretical fundament is only starting to emerge with major dependencies
        still to be uncovered. AIMS: A temperature or radius dependence is usually
        not included in descriptions for the mass loss of classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR)
        stars, despite being crucial for other hot star wind domains. We thus aim
        to determine whether such a dependency will also be necessary for a comprehensive
        description of mass loss in the cWR regime. METHODS: Sequences of dynamically
        consistent atmosphere models were calculated with the hydrodynamic branch
        of the PoWR code along the temperature domain, using different choices for
        luminosity, mass, and surface abundances. For the first time, we allowed nonmonotonic
        velocity fields when solving the equation of motion. The resulting velocity
        structures were then interpolated for the comoving-frame radiative transfer,
        ensuring that the main wind characteristics were preserved. RESULTS: We find
        a strong dependence of the mass-loss rate with the temperature of the critical/sonic
        point which mainly reflects the different radii and resulting gravitational
        accelerations. Moreover, we obtain a relation between the observed effective
        temperature and the transformed mass-loss rate which seems to be largely independent
        of the underlying stellar parameters. The relation shifts for different clumping
        factors in the outer wind. Below a characteristic value of -4.5, the slope
        of this relation changes and the winds become transparent for He II ionizing
        photons. CONCLUSIONS: The mass loss of cWR stars is a high-dimensional problem
        but also shows inherent scalings which can be used to obtain an approximation
        of the observed effective temperature. (...)\",\n        \"author\":[\"Sander,

        systems and will interact with a companion during their lifetimes, which helps
        to explain the observed diversity of core-collapse supernovae. Donor stars
        in binary systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass
        transfer. As a result, not only are the surface properties affected, but so
        is the core structure. However, most calculations of the core-collapse properties
        of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study
        of the difference between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and
        stars of the same initial mass (11-21 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) that have been stripped
        due to stable post-main-sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present
        the pre-supernova core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive
        representation of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies,
        at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain
        an extended gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer remains until
        core collapse and is more extended in mass for higher initial stellar masses.
        It originates from the receding of the convective helium core during core
        helium burning in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star
        models. We find that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences
        in the final density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped
        star models have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment
        of core collapse compared to single-star models, which likely results in systematically
        different supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning
        and oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications
        of our findings for the \\\"explodability\\\", supernova observations, and
        nucleosynthesis of these stars. Our models are publicly available and can

        trigger explosions of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) to determine their
        nucleosynthesis or ejecta and remnant properties. Recently, their use in spherically
        symmetric (1D) hydrodynamic simulations led to the result that <SUP>56,57</SUP>Ni
        and <SUP>44</SUP>Ti are massively underproduced compared to observational
        estimates for Supernova 1987A, if the explosions are slow, i.e. if the explosion
        mechanism of CCSNe releases the explosion energy on long time-scales. It was
        concluded that rapid explosions are required to match observed abundances,
        i.e. the explosion mechanism must provide the CCSN energy nearly instantaneously
        on time-scales of some ten to order 100 ms. This result, if valid, would disfavour
        the neutrino-heating mechanism, which releases the CCSN energy on time-scales
        of seconds. Here, we demonstrate by 1D hydrodynamic simulations and nucleosynthetic
        post-processing that these conclusions are a consequence of disregarding the
        initial collapse of the stellar core in the thermal-bomb modelling before
        the bomb releases the explosion energy. We demonstrate that the anticorrelation
        of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni yield and energy-injection time-scale vanishes when the
        initial collapse is included and that it can even be reversed, i.e. more <SUP>56</SUP>Ni
        is made by slower explosions, when the collapse proceeds to small radii similar
        to those where neutrino heating takes place in CCSNe. We also show that the
        <SUP>56</SUP>Ni production in thermal-bomb explosions is sensitive to the
        chosen mass cut and that a fixed mass layer or fixed volume for the energy
        deposition cause only secondary differences. Moreover, we propose a most appropriate

        nebula (PWN). We use hydrodynamic simulations of the remnant's evolution to
        show that the SNR reverse shock is interacting with the PWN and has most likely
        shocked the majority of the supernova ejecta. In our models, such a scenario
        requires a total ejecta mass of \u22723 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> and implies that
        there is no significant quantity of cold ejecta in the interior of the reverse

        physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics.
        Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open
        source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications
        in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution
        module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations
        of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass
        to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves
        the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses
        adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports
        shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide
        equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data,
        and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate
        Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate
        independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive
        verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the
        wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary
        tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very
        old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M <SUB>sun</SUB> star from
        the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed
        profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning
        phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase;
        the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the
        complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of
        core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and
        the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star. MESA can be downloaded
        from the project Web site (<A href=\\\"http://mesa.sourceforge.net/\\\">http://mesa.sourceforge.net/</A>).\",\n

        nucleosynthetic yield of isotopes lighter than A = 66 (zinc) is determined

        Z = 0, l0<SUP>-4</SUP>, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 times solar (a slightly reduced mass
        grid is employed for nonsolar metallicities). Altogether 78 different model
        supernova explosions are calculated. In each case nucleosynthesis has already
        been determined for 200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the presupernova
        star, including the effects of time dependent convection. Here each star is
        exploded using a piston to give a specified final kinetic energy at infinity
        (typically 1.2 \xD7 10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs), and the explosive modifications
        to the nucleosynthesis, including the effects of neutrino irradiation, determined.
        A single value of the critical <SUP>12</SUP>C(\u03B1,\u03B3) <SUP>16</SUP>O
        reaction rate corresponding to 8(300 keV) = 170 keV barns is used in all calculations.
        The synthesis of each isotope is discussed along with its sensitivity to model
        parameters. In each case, the final mass of the collapsed remnant is also
        determined and often found not to correspond to the location of the piston
        (typically the edge of the iron core), but to a \\\"mass cut\\\" farther out.
        This mass cut is sensitive not only to the explosion energy, but also to the
        presupernova structure, stellar mass, and the metallicity. Unless the explosion
        mechanism, for unknown reasons, provides a much larger characteristic energy
        in more massive stars, it appears likely that stars larger than about 30 M<SUB>sun</SUB>
        will experience considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the initial
        launch of a successful shock. While such explosions will produce a viable,
        bright Type II supernova light curve, lacking perhaps the radioactive tail,
        they will have dramatically reduced yields of heavy elements and may leave
        black hole remnants of up to 10 and more solar masses. The production of black
        holes may be particularly favored for stars of low metallicity, both because

        model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to
        masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology
        enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling
        of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates
        a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented
        when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the
        way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing.
        We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> stars through the end
        of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white

        /> Aims: Many topical astrophysical research areas, such as the properties
        of planet host stars, the nature of the progenitors of different types of
        supernovae and gamma ray bursts, and the evolution of galaxies, require complete
        and homogeneous sets of stellar models at different metallicities in order
        to be studied during the whole of cosmic history. We present here a first
        set of models for solar metallicity, where the effects of rotation are accounted
        for in a homogeneous way. <BR /> Methods: We computed a grid of 48 different
        stellar evolutionary tracks, both rotating and non-rotating, at Z = 0.014,
        spanning a wide mass range from 0.8 to 120 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. For each of
        the stellar masses considered, electronic tables provide data for 400 stages
        along the evolutionary track and at each stage, a set of 43 physical data
        are given. These grids thus provide an extensive and detailed data basis for
        comparisons with the observations. The rotating models start on the zero-age
        main sequence (ZAMS) with a rotation rate \u03C5<SUB>ini</SUB>/\u03C5<SUB>crit</SUB>
        = 0.4. The evolution is computed until the end of the central carbon-burning
        phase, the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, or the core helium-flash
        for, respectively, the massive, intermediate, and both low and very low mass
        stars. The initial abundances are those deduced by Asplund and collaborators,
        which best fit the observed abundances of massive stars in the solar neighbourhood.
        We update both the opacities and nuclear reaction rates, and introduce new
        prescriptions for the mass-loss rates as stars approach the Eddington and/or
        the critical velocity. We account for both atomic diffusion and magnetic braking
        in our low-mass star models. <BR /> Results: The present rotating models provide
        a good description of the average evolution of non-interacting stars. In particular,
        they reproduce the observed main-sequence width, the positions of the red
        giant and supergiant stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, the observed
        surface compositions and rotational velocities. Very interestingly, the enhancement
        of the mass loss during the red-supergiant stage, when the luminosity becomes
        supra-Eddington in some outer layers, help models above 15-20 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>
        to lose a significant part of their hydrogen envelope and evolve back into
        the blue part of the HR diagram. This result has interesting consequences
        for the blue to red supergiant ratio, the minimum mass for stars to become
        Wolf-Rayet stars, and the maximum initial mass of stars that explode as type
        II-P supernovae. <P />Tracks and isochrones are available at the CDS via anonymous

        10. The calculation of this grid completes the Vink et al. (2000) mass-loss
        recipe with an additional parameter Z. We have found that the exponent of
        the power law dependence of mass loss vs. metallicity is constant in the range
        between 1/30 &lt;= Z/Z<SUB>sun</SUB> &lt;= 3. The mass-loss rate scales as
        dot M ~ Z<SUP>0.85</SUP> v<SUB>infty </SUB><SUP>p</SUP> with p = -1.23 for
        stars with T_eff &gt;~ 25 000 K, and p = -1.60 for the B supergiants with
        T_eff &lt;~ 25 000 K. Taking also into account the metallicity dependence
        of v<SUB>infty </SUB>, using the power law dependence v<SUB>infty </SUB> ~
        Z<SUP>0.13</SUP> from Leitherer et al. (1992), the overall result of mass

        mass loss vs. metallicity dependence is constant over a large range in Z,
        one should be aware of the presence of bi-stability jumps at specific temperatures.
        Here the character of the line driving changes drastically due to recombinations
        of dominant metal species resulting in jumps in the mass loss. We have investigated
        the physical origins of these jumps and have derived formulae that combine
        mass loss recipes for both sides of such jumps. As observations of different
        galaxies show that the ratio Fe/O varies with metallicity, we make a distinction
        between the metal abundance Z derived on the basis of iron or oxygen lines.
        Our mass-loss predictions are successful in explaining the observed mass-loss
        rates for Galactic and Small Magellanic Cloud O-type stars, as well as in
        predicting the observed Galactic bi-stability jump. Hence, we believe that
        our predictions are reliable and suggest that our mass-loss recipe be used
        in future evolutionary calculations of massive stars at different metal abundance.

        After combining the samples from the various surveys and correcting for their

        at short orbital periods P \u2272 20 days (separations a \u2272 0.4 au), the

        3.5 (a \u2248 10 au), where the binaries have mass ratios weighted toward

        medium (ISM) in distant galaxies via molecular and atomic fine structure line
        (FSL) emission have gone from a curious look into a few extreme, rare objects
        to a mainstream tool for studying galaxy formation out to the highest redshifts.
        Molecular gas has been observed in close to 200 galaxies at z &gt; 1, including
        numerous AGN host-galaxies out to z \u223C 7, highly star-forming submillimeter
        galaxies, and increasing samples of main-sequence color-selected star-forming
        galaxies at z \u223C 1.5 to 2.5. Studies have moved well beyond simple detections
        to dynamical imaging at kiloparsec-scale resolution and multiline, multispecies
        studies that determine the physical conditions in the ISM in early galaxies.
        Observations of the cool gas are the required complement to studies of the
        stellar density and star-formation history of the Universe as they reveal
        the phase of the ISM that immediately precedes star formation in galaxies.
        Current observations suggest that the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic
        star-formation rate density from z \u223C 0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar
        increase in the gas-to-stellar mass ratio in star-forming disk galaxies. Progress
        has been made in determining the CO luminosity to H<SUB>2</SUB> mass conversion
        factor at high z, and the dichotomy between high versus low values for main-sequence
        versus starburst galaxies, respectively, appears to persist with increasing
        redshift, with a likely dependence on metallicity and other local physical
        conditions. There may also be two sequences in the relationship between star-formation
        rate and gas mass: one for starbursts, in which the gas consumption timescale
        is short (a few 10<SUP>7</SUP> years), and one for main sequence galaxies,
        with an order of magnitude longer gas consumption timescale. Studies of atomic
        FSL emission are rapidly progressing, with some tens of galaxies detected
        in the exceptionally bright [Cii] 158-\u03BCm line to date. The [Cii] line
        is proving to be a unique tracer of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe
        and, together with other atomic FSLs, has the potential to be the most direct
        means of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the first galaxies during cosmic
        reionization.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Carilli, C. L.\",\n          \"Walter,

        of the interstellar medium in disk galaxies is in the form of neutral atomic
        hydrogen, H I. This gas can be in thermal equilibrium at relatively low temperatures,
        T&lt;~300 K (the cold neutral medium [CNM]), or at temperatures somewhat less
        than 10<SUP>4</SUP> K (the warm neutral medium [WNM]). These two phases can
        coexist over a narrow range of pressures, P<SUB>min</SUB>&lt;=P&lt;=P<SUB>max</SUB>.
        We determine P<SUB>min</SUB> and P<SUB>max</SUB> in the plane of the Galaxy
        as a function of Galactocentric radius R using recent determinations of the
        gas heating rate and the gas-phase abundances of interstellar gas. We provide
        an analytic approximation for P<SUB>min</SUB> as a function of metallicity,
        far-ultraviolet radiation field, and the ionization rate of atomic hydrogen.
        Our analytic results show that the existence of P<SUB>min</SUB>, or the possibility
        of a two-phase equilibrium, generally requires that H<SUP>+</SUP> exceed C<SUP>+</SUP>
        in abundance at P<SUB>min</SUB>. The abundance of H<SUP>+</SUP> is set by
        EUV/soft X-ray photoionization and by recombination with negatively charged
        polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In order to assess whether thermal or pressure
        equilibrium is a realistic assumption, we define a parameter \u03A5\u2261t<SUB>cool</SUB>/t<SUB>shock</SUB>,
        where t<SUB>cool</SUB> is the gas cooling time and t<SUB>shock</SUB> is the
        characteristic shock time or ``time between shocks in a turbulent medium.''
        For \u03A5&lt;1 gas has time to reach thermal balance between supernova-induced
        shocks. We find that this condition is satisfied in the Galactic disk, and
        thus the two-phase description of the interstellar H I is approximately valid
        even in the presence of interstellar turbulence. Observationally, the mean
        density HI&gt; is often better determined than the local density, and we cast
        our results in terms of HI&gt; as well. Over most of the disk of the Galaxy,
        the H I must be in two phases: the weight of the H I in the gravitational
        potential of the Galaxy is large enough to generate thermal pressures exceeding
        P<SUB>min</SUB>, so that turbulent pressure fluctuations can produce cold
        gas that is thermally stable; and the mean density of the H I is too low for
        the gas to be all CNM. Our models predict the presence of CNM gas to R~=16-18
        kpc, somewhat farther than previous estimates. An estimate for the typical
        thermal pressure in the Galactic plane for 3kpc&lt;~R&lt;~18 kpc is P<SUB>th</SUB>/k~=1.4\xD710<SUP>4</SUP>exp(-R/5.5kpc)
        K cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. At the solar circle, this gives P<SUB>th</SUB>/k~=3000

        I<SUB>tot</SUB> ratio observed by Jenkins &amp; Tripp and the CNM temperature
        found by Heiles &amp; Troland. We also examine the potential impact of turbulent
        heating on our results and provide parameterized expressions for the heating
        rate as a function of Galactic radius. Although the uncertainties are large,
        our models predict that including turbulent heating does not significantly

        present a quantitative model for the infrared emission from dust in the diffuse
        interstellar medium. The model consists of a mixture of amorphous silicate
        grains and carbonaceous grains, each with a wide size distribution ranging
        from molecules containing tens of atoms to large grains &gt;~1 \u03BCm in
        diameter. We assume that the carbonaceous grains have properties like polycyclic
        aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at very small sizes and graphitic properties
        for radii a&gt;~50 \xC5. On the basis of recent laboratory studies and guided
        by astronomical observations, we propose ``astronomical'' absorption cross
        sections for use in modeling neutral and ionized PAHs from the far-ultraviolet
        to the far-infrared. We also propose modifications to the far-infrared emissivity
        of ``astronomical silicate.'' We calculate energy distribution functions for
        small grains undergoing ``temperature spikes'' caused by stochastic absorption
        of starlight photons using realistic heat capacities and optical properties.
        Using a grain-size distribution consistent with the observed interstellar
        extinction, we are able to reproduce the near-IR to submillimeter emission
        spectrum of the diffuse interstellar medium, including the PAH emission features
        at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 \u03BCm. The model is compared with the observed
        emission at high Galactic latitudes as well as in the Galactic plane, as measured
        by the COBE/DIRBE, COBE/FIRAS, IRTS/MIRS, and IRTS/NIRS instruments. The model
        has 60\xD710<SUP>-6</SUP> of C (relative to H) locked up in PAHs, with 45\xD710<SUP>-6</SUP>
        of C in a component peaking at ~6 \xC5 (N<SUB>C</SUB>~100 carbon atoms) to
        account for the PAH emission features and with 15\xD710<SUP>-6</SUP> of C

        total infrared emission is in excellent agreement with COBE/DIRBE observations

        mass-loss rates of 64 Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are used to study the
        dependence of mass-loss rates, momentum transfer efficiencies and terminal
        velocities on the basic stellar parameters and chemical composition. The luminosities
        of the WR stars have been determined either directly from the masses, using
        the dependence of L on mass predicted by stellar evolution theory, or they
        were determined from the absolute visual magnitudes and the bolometric corrections.
        For this purpose we improved the relation between the bolometric correction
        and the spectral subclass. (1) The momentum transfer efficiencies \u03B7 (i.e.
        the ratio between the wind momentum loss and radiative momentum loss) of WR
        stars are found to lie in the range of 1.4 to 17.6, with the mean value of
        6.2 for the 64 program stars. Such values can probably be explained by radiative
        driving due to multiple scattering of photons in a WR wind with an ionization
        stratification. However, there may be a problem in explaining the driving
        at low velocities. (2) We derived the linear regression relations for the
        dependence of the terminal velocity, the momentum transfer efficiency and
        the mass-loss rates on luminosity and chemical composition. We found a tight
        relation between the terminal velocity of the wind and the parameters of the
        hydrostatic core. This relation enables the determination of the mass of the
        WR stars from their observed terminal velocities and chemical composition
        with an accuracy of about 0.1 dex for WN and WC stars. Using evolutionary
        models of WR stars, the luminosity can then be determined with an accuracy
        of 0.25 dex or better. (3) We found that the mass-loss rates (&amp;mathaccent
        \\\"705Frelax dot;) of WR stars depend strongly on luminosity and also quite
        strongly on chemical composition. For the combined sample of WN and WC stars

        of \u03C3 = 0.19 dex (4) The new mass-loss rates are significantly smaller
        than adopted in evolutionary calculations, by about 0.2 to 0.6 dex, depending
        on the composition and on the evolutionary calculations. For H-rich WN stars
        the new mass-loss rates are 0.3 dex smaller than adopted in the evolutionary
        calculations of Meynet et al. (1994). (5) The lower mass-loss rates, derived
        in this paper compared to previously adopted values, facilitate the formation
        of black holes as end points of the evolution of massive stars. However they

        \       \"abstract\":\"Grids of models for rotating stars are constructed
        in the range of 9 to 120 M<SUB>sun</SUB> at solar metallicity. The following
        effects of rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations
        for non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with
        rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal turbulence,
        shear instability and coupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion
        of angular momentum treated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion
        of the chemical elements. Globally we find that for massive stars the effects
        of rotation have an importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional
        circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in 1-2%
        of the MS lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then slowly evolves
        during the MS phase. The circulation shows two main cells. In the deep interior,
        circulation rises along the polar axis and goes down at the equator, while
        due to the Gratton-\xD6pik term it is the inverse in outer layers. This external
        inverse circulation grows in depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that
        a stationary approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation
        would be inappropriate. After the MS phase, the effects of core contraction
        and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum. The
        surface velocities decrease very much during the MS evolution of the most
        massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a lot of angular
        momentum. This produces some convergence of the velocities, but not necessarily
        towards the break-up velocities. However, stars with masses below ~ 12 M<SUB>sun</SUB>
        with initially high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near
        the end of the MS phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some
        other interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out.
        For an average rotation, the tracks in the HR diagram are modified like a
        moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may increase
        the MS lifetime up to about 30%; for the helium-burning phase the effects
        are smaller and amount to at most 10%. From plots of the isochrones, we find
        that rotation may increase the age estimate by about 25% in general. However,
        for stars with M &gt;~ 40 M<SUB>sun</SUB> and fast rotation, a bluewards ``homogeneous-like''
        track, with important He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting
        the age estimates for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large
        scatter in the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g_eff and log T_eff,
        differences of masses by 30% may easily occur, thus explaining what still
        remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings significant
        surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher masses and rotation.
        While it is not difficult to explain very fast rotators with He- and N-excesses,
        the present models also well account for the many OB stars exhibiting surface
        enrichments and moderate or low rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. \\\\cite{He92},
        \\\\cite{He20}). These stars likely result from initially fast rotators, which
        experienced mixing and lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass
        loss. The comparison of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports
        the conclusion by Venn (\\\\cite{ve95a}, \\\\cite{Ve99}), that these enrichments
        mostly result from mixing during the MS phase, which is also in agreement

        systems and will interact with a companion during their lifetimes, which helps
        to explain the observed diversity of core-collapse supernovae. Donor stars
        in binary systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass
        transfer. As a result, not only are the surface properties affected, but so
        is the core structure. However, most calculations of the core-collapse properties
        of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study
        of the difference between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and
        stars of the same initial mass (11-21 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) that have been stripped
        due to stable post-main-sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present
        the pre-supernova core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive
        representation of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies,
        at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain
        an extended gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer remains until
        core collapse and is more extended in mass for higher initial stellar masses.
        It originates from the receding of the convective helium core during core
        helium burning in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star
        models. We find that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences
        in the final density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped
        star models have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment
        of core collapse compared to single-star models, which likely results in systematically
        different supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning
        and oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications
        of our findings for the \\\"explodability\\\", supernova observations, and

        mass-loss rates of massive helium stars are one of the major uncertainties
        in modern astrophysics. Regardless of whether they were stripped by a binary
        companion or managed to peel off their outer layers by themselves, the influence
        and final fate of helium stars - in particular the resulting black hole mass
        - highly depends on their wind mass-loss as stripped-envelope objects. While
        empirical mass-loss constraints for massive helium stars have improved over
        the last decades, the resulting recipes are limited to metallicities with
        the observational ability to sufficiently resolve individual stars. Yet, theoretical
        efforts have been hampered by the complexity of Wolf-Rayet (WR) winds arising
        from the more massive helium stars. In an unprecedented effort, we calculate
        next-generation stellar atmosphere models resembling massive helium main-sequence
        stars with Fe-bump driven winds up to $500\\\\, \\\\mathrm{M}_\\\\odot$ over
        a wide metallicity range between 2.0 and $0.02\\\\, \\\\mathrm{Z}_\\\\odot$
        . We uncover a complex \u0393<SUB>e</SUB>-dependency of WR-type winds and
        their metallicity-dependent breakdown. The latter can be related to the onset
        of multiple scattering, requiring higher L/M-ratios at lower metallicity.
        Based on our findings, we derive the first ever theoretically motivated mass-loss
        recipe for massive helium stars. We also provide estimates for Lyman continuum
        and $\\\\rm{He\\\\,{\\\\small II}}$ -=ionizing fluxes, finding stripped helium
        stars to contribute considerably at low metallicity. In sharp contrast to
        OB-star winds, the mass-loss for helium stars scales with the terminal velocity.
        While limited to the helium main sequence, our study marks a major step towards
        a better theoretical understanding of helium star evolution.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Sander,

        era of large transient surveys, gravitational-wave observatories, and multi-messenger
        astronomy has opened up new possibilities for our understanding of the evolution
        and final fate of massive stars. Most massive stars are born in binary or
        higher-order multiple systems and exchange mass with a companion star during
        their lives. In particular, the progenitors of a large fraction of compact-object
        mergers, and Galactic neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) have been
        stripped of their envelopes by a binary companion. Here, we study the evolution
        of single and stripped binary stars up to core collapse with the stellar evolution
        code MESA and their final fates with a parametric supernova (SN) model. We
        find that stripped binary stars can have systematically different pre-SN structures
        compared to genuine single stars and thus also different SN outcomes. These
        differences are already established by the end of core helium burning and
        are preserved up to core collapse. Consequently, we find that Case A and B
        stripped stars and single and Case C stripped stars develop qualitatively
        similar pre-SN core structures. We find a non-monotonic pattern of NS and
        BH formation as a function of CO core mass that is different in single and
        stripped binary stars. In terms of initial mass, single stars of \u227335
        M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> all form BHs, while this transition is only at about 70
        M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> in stripped stars. On average, stripped stars give rise
        to lower NS and BH masses, higher explosion energies, higher kick velocities,
        and higher nickel yields. Within a simplified population-synthesis model,
        we show that our results lead to a significant reduction in the rates of BH-NS
        and BH-BH mergers with respect to typical assumptions made on NS and BH formation.
        Therefore, our models predict lower detection rates of such merger events
        with for example the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
        (LIGO) than is often considered. Further, we show how certain features in
        the NS-BH mass distribution of single and stripped stars relate to the chirp-mass
        distribution of compact object mergers. Further implications of our findings
        are discussed with respect to the missing red-supergiant problem, a possible
        mass gap between NSs and BHs, X-ray binaries, and observationally inferred
        nickel masses from Type Ib/c and IIP SNe.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Schneider,

        the combined effect of metallicity, mass loss, and rotation for a large grid

        of rotating massive stars at sub-solar metallicities. We find that those stars
        produce primary F and dominate its solar abundance and we confirm their role
        in the observed primary behaviour of N. In contrast, we show that their action
        is insufficient to explain the small observed values of ^{12}C/^{13}C in halo

        as an alternative source of processed material. We compute the evolution of

        non conservative mass and angular momentum transfer and of rotation and tidal

        similar to the abundance patterns observed in gobular cluster stars. However,
        Mg is not significantly depleted in the ejecta of this model. In contrast
        to the fast, radiatively driven winds of massive stars, this material is typically
        ejected with low velocity. We expect that it remains inside the potential

        components, and of single helium stars with initial masses of 2.8-20 M <SUB>sun</SUB>.
        We find that, despite the impact of tidal interaction on the rotation of primary
        stars, the amount of angular momentum retained in the core at the presupernova
        stage in different binary model sequences converges to a value similar to
        those found in previous single star models. This amount is large enough to
        produce millisecond pulsars, but too small to produce magnetars or long gamma-ray
        bursts. We employ the most up-to-date estimate for the Wolf-Rayet mass-loss
        rate, and its implications for SN Ib/c progenitors are discussed in detail.
        In terms of stellar structure, SN Ib/c progenitors in binary systems at solar
        metallicity are predicted to have a wide range of final masses up to about
        7 M <SUB>sun</SUB>, with helium envelopes of M <SUB>He</SUB> ~= 0.16-1.5 M
        <SUB>sun</SUB>. Our results indicate that, if the lack of helium lines in
        the spectra of SNe Ic were due to small amounts of helium (e.g., M <SUB>He</SUB>
        &lt;~ 0.5), the distribution of both initial and final masses of SN Ic progenitors
        should be bimodal. Furthermore, we find that a thin hydrogen layer (0.001
        M <SUB>sun</SUB> &lt;~ M <SUB>H</SUB> &lt;~ 0.01 M <SUB>sun</SUB>) is expected
        to be present in many SN Ib progenitors at the presupernova stage. We show
        that the presence of hydrogen, together with a rather thick helium envelope,
        can lead to a significant expansion of some SN Ib/c progenitors by the time
        of supernova explosion. This may have important consequences for the shock
        break-out and supernova light curve. We also argue that some SN progenitors
        with thin hydrogen layers produced via Case AB/B transfer might be related
        to Type IIb supernova progenitors with relatively small radii of about 10
        R <SUB>sun</SUB>.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Yoon, S. -C.\",\n          \"Woosley,

        Generally, we find that binary-stripped stars core tend to have a smaller

        stars based on binary evolution models computed with MESA. We use these to
        investigate their radius evolution as a function of mass and metallicity.
        We further discuss their pre-supernova observable characteristics and potential
        consequences of their evolution on the properties of supernovae from stripped
        stars. At high metallicity, we find that practically all of the hydrogen-rich
        envelope is removed, which is in agreement with earlier findings. Only progenitors
        with initial masses below 10 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> expand to large radii (up
        to 100 R<SUB>\u2299</SUB>), while more massive progenitors remain compact.
        At low metallicity, a substantial amount of hydrogen remains and the progenitors
        can, in principle, expand to giant sizes (&gt; 400 R<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) for
        all masses we consider. This implies that they can fill their Roche lobe anew.
        We show that the prescriptions commonly used in population synthesis models
        underestimate the stellar radii by up to two orders of magnitude. We expect
        that this has consequences for the predictions for gravitational-wave sources
        from double neutron star mergers, particularly with regard to their metallicity
        dependence. <P />The models are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp

        mass loss. The origin of the variability of the Hubble-Sandage variables is
        discussed in relation with the instability limit (de Jager's limit) for deep
        turbulent external convective zones in supergiants. This limit may also be
        responsible for the fact that the brightest red supergiants are 2 mag fainter

        the surface, what is likely to correspond to the beginning of the WC stage.
        We note then a very steep disappearance of <SUP>13</SUP>C and <SUP>14</SUP>N,
        a very temporary peak of <SUP>18</SUP>O, and above all a vertiginous rise

        rise strongly, particularly in the most massive WC stars, where s-elements

        C/He, N/He, and C/N ratios and those observed by Smith and Willis (1982) and
        by Nugis (1982) for WNL, WNE, and WC stars. The general agreement strongly
        supports the advanced evolutionary stage of WR stars as left-over cores resulting
        from the peeling of massive stars by stellar winds. If confirmed, the presence

        important at low metallicity, when mass loss by stellar winds diminishes and
        the surface enrichment due to rotational mixing becomes relatively more pronounced
        than at high metallicities. Here we investigate the impact of rotation and
        metallicity on stellar evolution. Using similar physics as in our previous
        large grids of models at Z = 0.002 and Z = 0.014, we compute stellar evolution
        models with the Geneva code for rotating and nonrotating stars with initial

        (1/35 solar). This is comparable to the metallicities of the most metal poor
        galaxies observed so far, such as I Zw 18. Concerning massive stars, both
        rotating and nonrotating models spend most of their core-helium burning phase
        with an effective temperature higher than 8000 K. Stars become red supergiants
        only at the end of their lifetimes, and few red supergiants are expected.
        Our models predict very few to no classical Wolf-Rayet stars as a results
        of weak stellar winds at low metallicity. The most massive stars end their
        lifetimes as luminous blue supergiants or luminous blue variables, a feature
        that is not predicted by models with higher initial metallicities. Interestingly,
        due to the behavior of the intermediate convective zone, the mass domain of
        stars producing pair-instability supernovae is smaller at Z = 0.0004 than
        at Z = 0.002. We find that during the main sequence (MS) phase, the ratio
        between nitrogen and carbon abundances (N/C) remains unchanged for nonrotating
        models. However, N/C increases by factors of 10-20 in rotating models at the

        15, 20, 25, 40 and 60 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> were computed from the ZAMS until
        the end of the core silicon burning phase. We took into account meridional
        circulation, secular shear instabilities, horizontal turbulence and dynamical
        shear instabilities. We find that dynamical shear instabilities mainly smoothen
        the sharp angular velocity gradients but do not transport angular momentum
        or chemical species over long distances. Most of the differences between the
        pre-supernova structures obtained from rotating and non-rotating stellar models
        have their origin in the effects of rotation during the core hydrogen and
        helium burning phases. The advanced stellar evolutionary stages appear too
        short in time to allow the rotational instabilities considered in this work
        to have a significant impact during the late stages. In particular, the internal
        angular momentum does not change significantly during the advanced stages
        of the evolution. We can therefore have a good estimate of the final angular
        momentum at the end of the core helium burning phase. The effects of rotation
        on pre-supernova models are significant between 15 and 30 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>.
        Indeed, rotation increases the core sizes (and the yields) by a factor \u223C1.5.
        Above 20 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, rotation may change the radius or colour of the
        supernova progenitors (blue instead of red supergiant) and the supernova type
        (IIb or Ib instead of II). Rotation affects the lower mass limits for radiative
        core carbon burning, for iron core collapse and for black hole formation.
        For Wolf-Rayet stars (M \u2A86 30 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>), the pre-supernova structures
        are mostly affected by the intensities of the stellar winds and less by rotational
        mixing.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Hirschi, R.\",\n          \"Meynet, G.\",\n

        being due to uncertainties in the treatment of convection. Our results revise

        close binaries with various initial masses, mass ratios and periods, we derive
        primary initial-final mass, initial mass-final helium core mass, and initial

        We emphasize that in binaries the critical initial mass limits for neutron

        Short-lived massive stars are generally considered as the main stellar sources.
        We examine the potential role of less massive stars that lose their envelope
        through interaction with a binary companion. Here, we focus on the role of
        metallicity (Z). For this purpose we used the evolutionary code MESA and created
        tailored atmosphere models with the radiative transfer code CMFGEN. We show
        that typical progenitors, with initial masses of 12 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, produce
        hot and compact stars ( 4 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, 60-80 kK, 1 R<SUB>\u2299</SUB>).
        These stripped stars copiously produce ionizing photons, emitting 60-85% and
        30-60% of their energy as HI and HeI ionizing radiation, for Z = 0.0001-0.02,
        respectively. Their output is comparable to what massive stars emit during
        their Wolf-Rayet phase, if we account for their longer lifetimes and the favorable
        slope of the initial mass function. Their relative importance for reionization
        may be further favored since they emit their photons with a time delay ( 20
        Myr after birth in our fiducial model). This allows time for the dispersal
        of the birth clouds, allowing the ionizing photons to escape into the intergalactic
        medium. At low Z, we find that Roche stripping fails to fully remove the H-rich
        envelope, because of the reduced opacity in the subsurface layers. This is
        in sharp contrast with the assumption of complete stripping that is made in
        rapid population synthesis simulations, which are widely used to simulate
        the binary progenitors of supernovae and gravitational waves. Finally, we

        is uncertain because of difficulties in observing and analyzing atomic and

        for F and G main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood with metallicities
        in the range -1.6 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; +0.4 in order to study trends and possible

        of approximately 50 early B-type stars in three young clusters at different
        metallicities, NGC 6611 in the Galaxy, N 11 in the Large Magellanic Cloud
        (LMC) and NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Using the tlusty non-LTE
        model atmospheres code, atmospheric parameters and photospheric abundances
        (C, N, O, Mg and Si) of each star have been determined. These results represent
        a significant improvement on the number of Magellanic Cloud B-type stars with
        detailed and homogeneous estimates of their atmospheric parameters and chemical
        compositions. The relationships between effective temperature and spectral
        type are discussed for all three metallicity regimes, with the effective temperature
        for a given spectral type increasing as one moves to a lower metallicity regime.
        Additionally the difficulties in estimating the microturbulent velocity and
        the anomalous values obtained, particularly in the lowest metallicity regime,
        are discussed. Our chemical composition estimates are compared with previous
        studies, both stellar and interstellar with, in general, encouraging agreement
        being found. Abundances in the Magellanic Clouds relative to the Galaxy are
        discussed and we also present our best estimates of the base-line chemical
        composition of the LMC and SMC as derived from B-type stars. Additionally
        we discuss the use of nitrogen as a probe of the evolutionary history of stars,
        investigating the roles of rotational mixing, mass-loss, blue loops and binarity

        loss processes are a key uncertainty in the evolution of massive stars. They
        determine the amount of mass and angular momentum retained by the star, thus
        influencing its evolution and presupernova structure. Because of the high
        complexity of the physical processes driving mass loss, stellar evolution
        calculations must employ parametric algorithms, and usually only include wind
        mass loss. We carried out an extensive parameter study of wind mass loss and
        its effects on massive star evolution using the open-source stellar evolution
        code MESA. We provide a systematic comparison of wind mass loss algorithms
        for solar-metallicity, nonrotating, single stars in the initial mass range
        of 15 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> to 35 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. We consider combinations
        drawn from two hot phase (I.e., roughly the main sequence) algorithms, three
        cool phase (I.e., post-main-sequence) algorithms, and two Wolf-Rayet mass
        loss algorithms. We discuss separately the effects of mass loss in each of
        these phases. In addition, we consider linear wind efficiency scale factors
        of 1, 0.33, and 0.1 to account for suggested reductions in mass loss rates
        due to wind inhomogeneities. We find that the initial to final mass mapping
        for each zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass has a 50% uncertainty if all algorithm
        combinations and wind efficiencies are considered. The ad-hoc efficiency scale
        factor dominates this uncertainty. While the final total mass and internal
        structure of our models vary tremendously with mass loss treatment, final
        luminosity and effective temperature are much less sensitive for stars with
        ZAMS mass \u2272 30 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. This indicates that uncertainty in
        wind mass loss does not negatively affect estimates of the ZAMS mass of most
        single-star supernova progenitors from pre-explosion observations. Our results
        furthermore show that the internal structure of presupernova stars is sensitive
        to variations in both main sequence and post main-sequence mass loss. The
        compactness parameter \u03BE \u221D \u2133 /R(\u2133) has been identified
        as a proxy for the \\\"explodability\\\" of a given presupernova model. We
        find that \u03BE varies by as much as 30% for models of the same ZAMS mass
        evolved with different wind efficiencies and mass loss algorithm combinations.
        This suggests that the details of the mass loss treatment might bias the outcome
        of detailed core-collapse supernova calculations and the predictions for neutron
        star and black hole formation. <P />Data output is available at the CDS via

        supernovae (CCSN) and which implode into BHs-profoundly affects the initial-mass-function

        the work of Sukhbold et al., we compute IMF-averaged yields at solar metallicity
        for a wide range of assumptions, including neutrino-driven engine models with
        extensive BH formation, models with a simple mass threshold for BH formation,
        and a model in which all stars from 8 to 120 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> explode. For
        plausible choices, the overall yields of \u03B1-elements span a factor of
        3, but changes in relative yields are more subtle, typically 0.05-0.2 dex.
        To constrain the overall level of BH formation, ratios of C and N to O or
        Mg are promising diagnostics. To distinguish complex, theoretically motivated
        landscapes from simple mass thresholds, abundance ratios involving Mn or Ni
        are promising because of their sensitivity to the core structure of the CCSN

        the discrepancies offer empirical clues to aspects of massive star evolution

        early B-type stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and found several groups
        of stars that have chemical compositions that conflict with the theory of
        rotational mixing. Here we extend this study to Galactic and Small Magellanic
        Cloud (SMC) metallicities. <BR />Methods: We provide chemical compositions
        for ~50 Galactic and ~100 SMC early B-type stars and compare these to the
        LMC results. These samples cover a range of projected rotational velocities
        up to ~300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and hence are well suited to testing rotational
        mixing models. The surface nitrogen abundances are utilised as a probe of
        the mixing process since nitrogen is synthesized in the core of the stars
        and mixed to the surface. <BR />Results: In the SMC, we find a population
        of slowly rotating nitrogen-rich stars amongst the early B type core-hydrogen
        burning stars, which is comparable to that found previously in the LMC. The
        identification of non-enriched rapid rotators in the SMC is not possible due
        to the relatively high upper limits on the nitrogen abundance for the fast
        rotators. In the Galactic sample we find no significant enrichment amongst
        the core hydrogen-burning stars, which appears to be in contrast with the
        expectation from both rotating single-star and close binary evolution models.
        However, only a small number of the rapidly rotating stars have evolved enough
        to produce a significant nitrogen enrichment, and these may be analogous to
        the non-enriched rapid rotators previously found in the LMC sample. Finally,
        in each metallicity regime, a population of highly enriched supergiants is
        observed, which cannot be the immediate descendants of core-hydrogen burning
        stars. Their abundances are, however, compatible with them having gone through
        a previous red supergiant phase. Together, these observations paint a complex
        picture of the nitrogen enrichment in massive main sequence and supergiant
        stellar atmospheres, where age and binarity cause crucial effects. Whether
        rotational mixing is required to understand our results remains an open question
        at this time, but could be answered by identifying the true binary fraction
        in those groups of stars that do not agree with single-star evolutionary models.

        of C from stars of low and intermediate mass. The former is, however, always
        the dominant factor. Our survey has also uncovered tentative evidence to suggest
        that, as the oxygen abundance decreases below [O/H] = -1, [C/O] may not remain
        constant at [C/O] = -0.5, as previously thought, but increase again, possibly
        approaching near-solar values at the lowest metallicities ([O/H] \u2272 -3).
        With the current dataset this is no more than a 3\u03C3 effect and it may
        be due to metallicity-dependent non-LTE corrections to the [C/O] ratio which
        have not been taken into account. However, its potential importance as a window
        on the nucleosynthesis by Population III stars is a strong incentive for future
        work, both observational and theoretical, to verify its reality. <P />Based

        Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open
        source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications
        in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution
        module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations
        of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass
        to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves
        the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses
        adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports
        shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide
        equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data,
        and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate
        Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate
        independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive
        verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the
        wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary
        tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very
        old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M <SUB>sun</SUB> star from
        the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed
        profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning
        phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase;
        the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the
        complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of
        core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and
        the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star. MESA can be downloaded

        supernova explosions are calculated. In each case nucleosynthesis has already
        been determined for 200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the presupernova
        star, including the effects of time dependent convection. Here each star is
        exploded using a piston to give a specified final kinetic energy at infinity
        (typically 1.2 \xD7 10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs), and the explosive modifications
        to the nucleosynthesis, including the effects of neutrino irradiation, determined.

        The synthesis of each isotope is discussed along with its sensitivity to model

        determined and often found not to correspond to the location of the piston
        (typically the edge of the iron core), but to a \\\"mass cut\\\" farther out.
        This mass cut is sensitive not only to the explosion energy, but also to the
        presupernova structure, stellar mass, and the metallicity. Unless the explosion
        mechanism, for unknown reasons, provides a much larger characteristic energy
        in more massive stars, it appears likely that stars larger than about 30 M<SUB>sun</SUB>
        will experience considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the initial
        launch of a successful shock. While such explosions will produce a viable,
        bright Type II supernova light curve, lacking perhaps the radioactive tail,
        they will have dramatically reduced yields of heavy elements and may leave
        black hole remnants of up to 10 and more solar masses. The production of black
        holes may be particularly favored for stars of low metallicity, both because

        substantially update the capabilities of the open source software package
        Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional
        stellar evolution module, MESA star. Improvements in MESA star's ability to
        model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to
        masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology
        enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling
        of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates
        a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented
        when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the
        way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing.
        We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> stars through the end
        of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white
        dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical
        abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare
        thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated
        envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core
        collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray
        burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the
        way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition

        /> Aims: Many topical astrophysical research areas, such as the properties
        of planet host stars, the nature of the progenitors of different types of
        supernovae and gamma ray bursts, and the evolution of galaxies, require complete
        and homogeneous sets of stellar models at different metallicities in order
        to be studied during the whole of cosmic history. We present here a first
        set of models for solar metallicity, where the effects of rotation are accounted
        for in a homogeneous way. <BR /> Methods: We computed a grid of 48 different
        stellar evolutionary tracks, both rotating and non-rotating, at Z = 0.014,
        spanning a wide mass range from 0.8 to 120 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. For each of
        the stellar masses considered, electronic tables provide data for 400 stages
        along the evolutionary track and at each stage, a set of 43 physical data
        are given. These grids thus provide an extensive and detailed data basis for
        comparisons with the observations. The rotating models start on the zero-age
        main sequence (ZAMS) with a rotation rate \u03C5<SUB>ini</SUB>/\u03C5<SUB>crit</SUB>
        = 0.4. The evolution is computed until the end of the central carbon-burning
        phase, the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, or the core helium-flash
        for, respectively, the massive, intermediate, and both low and very low mass
        stars. The initial abundances are those deduced by Asplund and collaborators,
        which best fit the observed abundances of massive stars in the solar neighbourhood.
        We update both the opacities and nuclear reaction rates, and introduce new
        prescriptions for the mass-loss rates as stars approach the Eddington and/or
        the critical velocity. We account for both atomic diffusion and magnetic braking
        in our low-mass star models. <BR /> Results: The present rotating models provide
        a good description of the average evolution of non-interacting stars. In particular,
        they reproduce the observed main-sequence width, the positions of the red
        giant and supergiant stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, the observed
        surface compositions and rotational velocities. Very interestingly, the enhancement
        of the mass loss during the red-supergiant stage, when the luminosity becomes
        supra-Eddington in some outer layers, help models above 15-20 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>
        to lose a significant part of their hydrogen envelope and evolve back into
        the blue part of the HR diagram. This result has interesting consequences
        for the blue to red supergiant ratio, the minimum mass for stars to become
        Wolf-Rayet stars, and the maximum initial mass of stars that explode as type
        II-P supernovae. <P />Tracks and isochrones are available at the CDS via anonymous

        stars with T_eff &gt;~ 25 000 K, and p = -1.60 for the B supergiants with
        T_eff &lt;~ 25 000 K. Taking also into account the metallicity dependence
        of v<SUB>infty </SUB>, using the power law dependence v<SUB>infty </SUB> ~
        Z<SUP>0.13</SUP> from Leitherer et al. (1992), the overall result of mass
        loss as a function of metallicity can be represented by dot M ~ Z<SUP>0.69</SUP>
        for stars with T_eff &gt;~ 25 000 K, and dot M ~ Z<SUP>0.64</SUP> for B supergiants
        with T_eff &lt;~ 25 000 K. Although it is derived that the exponent of the
        mass loss vs. metallicity dependence is constant over a large range in Z,
        one should be aware of the presence of bi-stability jumps at specific temperatures.
        Here the character of the line driving changes drastically due to recombinations
        of dominant metal species resulting in jumps in the mass loss. We have investigated
        the physical origins of these jumps and have derived formulae that combine
        mass loss recipes for both sides of such jumps. As observations of different
        galaxies show that the ratio Fe/O varies with metallicity, we make a distinction
        between the metal abundance Z derived on the basis of iron or oxygen lines.
        Our mass-loss predictions are successful in explaining the observed mass-loss
        rates for Galactic and Small Magellanic Cloud O-type stars, as well as in
        predicting the observed Galactic bi-stability jump. Hence, we believe that
        our predictions are reliable and suggest that our mass-loss recipe be used
        in future evolutionary calculations of massive stars at different metal abundance.

        After combining the samples from the various surveys and correcting for their

        at short orbital periods P \u2272 20 days (separations a \u2272 0.4 au), the
        binaries have small eccentricities e \u2272 0.4, favor modest mass ratios
        &lt; q&gt; \u2248 0.5, and exhibit a small excess of twins q &gt; 0.95. Second,
        the companion frequency peaks at intermediate periods log P (days) \u2248
        3.5 (a \u2248 10 au), where the binaries have mass ratios weighted toward
        small values q \u2248 0.2-0.3 and follow a Maxwellian \u201Cthermal\u201D
        eccentricity distribution. Finally, companions with long orbital periods log
        P (days) \u2248 5.5-7.5 (a \u2248 200-5000 au) are outer tertiary components

        mass function. We discuss these companion distributions and properties in

        medium (ISM) in distant galaxies via molecular and atomic fine structure line
        (FSL) emission have gone from a curious look into a few extreme, rare objects
        to a mainstream tool for studying galaxy formation out to the highest redshifts.
        Molecular gas has been observed in close to 200 galaxies at z &gt; 1, including
        numerous AGN host-galaxies out to z \u223C 7, highly star-forming submillimeter
        galaxies, and increasing samples of main-sequence color-selected star-forming
        galaxies at z \u223C 1.5 to 2.5. Studies have moved well beyond simple detections
        to dynamical imaging at kiloparsec-scale resolution and multiline, multispecies
        studies that determine the physical conditions in the ISM in early galaxies.
        Observations of the cool gas are the required complement to studies of the
        stellar density and star-formation history of the Universe as they reveal
        the phase of the ISM that immediately precedes star formation in galaxies.
        Current observations suggest that the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic
        star-formation rate density from z \u223C 0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar
        increase in the gas-to-stellar mass ratio in star-forming disk galaxies. Progress
        has been made in determining the CO luminosity to H<SUB>2</SUB> mass conversion
        factor at high z, and the dichotomy between high versus low values for main-sequence
        versus starburst galaxies, respectively, appears to persist with increasing
        redshift, with a likely dependence on metallicity and other local physical
        conditions. There may also be two sequences in the relationship between star-formation
        rate and gas mass: one for starbursts, in which the gas consumption timescale
        is short (a few 10<SUP>7</SUP> years), and one for main sequence galaxies,
        with an order of magnitude longer gas consumption timescale. Studies of atomic
        FSL emission are rapidly progressing, with some tens of galaxies detected
        in the exceptionally bright [Cii] 158-\u03BCm line to date. The [Cii] line
        is proving to be a unique tracer of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe
        and, together with other atomic FSLs, has the potential to be the most direct
        means of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the first galaxies during cosmic

        coexist over a narrow range of pressures, P<SUB>min</SUB>&lt;=P&lt;=P<SUB>max</SUB>.
        We determine P<SUB>min</SUB> and P<SUB>max</SUB> in the plane of the Galaxy

        gas heating rate and the gas-phase abundances of interstellar gas. We provide
        an analytic approximation for P<SUB>min</SUB> as a function of metallicity,
        far-ultraviolet radiation field, and the ionization rate of atomic hydrogen.
        Our analytic results show that the existence of P<SUB>min</SUB>, or the possibility
        of a two-phase equilibrium, generally requires that H<SUP>+</SUP> exceed C<SUP>+</SUP>
        in abundance at P<SUB>min</SUB>. The abundance of H<SUP>+</SUP> is set by
        EUV/soft X-ray photoionization and by recombination with negatively charged
        polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In order to assess whether thermal or pressure
        equilibrium is a realistic assumption, we define a parameter \u03A5\u2261t<SUB>cool</SUB>/t<SUB>shock</SUB>,
        where t<SUB>cool</SUB> is the gas cooling time and t<SUB>shock</SUB> is the
        characteristic shock time or ``time between shocks in a turbulent medium.''
        For \u03A5&lt;1 gas has time to reach thermal balance between supernova-induced
        shocks. We find that this condition is satisfied in the Galactic disk, and
        thus the two-phase description of the interstellar H I is approximately valid
        even in the presence of interstellar turbulence. Observationally, the mean
        density HI&gt; is often better determined than the local density, and we cast
        our results in terms of HI&gt; as well. Over most of the disk of the Galaxy,
        the H I must be in two phases: the weight of the H I in the gravitational
        potential of the Galaxy is large enough to generate thermal pressures exceeding
        P<SUB>min</SUB>, so that turbulent pressure fluctuations can produce cold
        gas that is thermally stable; and the mean density of the H I is too low for
        the gas to be all CNM. Our models predict the presence of CNM gas to R~=16-18
        kpc, somewhat farther than previous estimates. An estimate for the typical
        thermal pressure in the Galactic plane for 3kpc&lt;~R&lt;~18 kpc is P<SUB>th</SUB>/k~=1.4\xD710<SUP>4</SUP>exp(-R/5.5kpc)

        heating on our results and provide parameterized expressions for the heating
        rate as a function of Galactic radius. Although the uncertainties are large,

        grains and carbonaceous grains, each with a wide size distribution ranging
        from molecules containing tens of atoms to large grains &gt;~1 \u03BCm in

        dependence of mass-loss rates, momentum transfer efficiencies and terminal
        velocities on the basic stellar parameters and chemical composition. The luminosities
        of the WR stars have been determined either directly from the masses, using
        the dependence of L on mass predicted by stellar evolution theory, or they
        were determined from the absolute visual magnitudes and the bolometric corrections.
        For this purpose we improved the relation between the bolometric correction
        and the spectral subclass. (1) The momentum transfer efficiencies \u03B7 (i.e.
        the ratio between the wind momentum loss and radiative momentum loss) of WR
        stars are found to lie in the range of 1.4 to 17.6, with the mean value of
        6.2 for the 64 program stars. Such values can probably be explained by radiative
        driving due to multiple scattering of photons in a WR wind with an ionization
        stratification. However, there may be a problem in explaining the driving
        at low velocities. (2) We derived the linear regression relations for the
        dependence of the terminal velocity, the momentum transfer efficiency and
        the mass-loss rates on luminosity and chemical composition. We found a tight
        relation between the terminal velocity of the wind and the parameters of the
        hydrostatic core. This relation enables the determination of the mass of the
        WR stars from their observed terminal velocities and chemical composition
        with an accuracy of about 0.1 dex for WN and WC stars. Using evolutionary
        models of WR stars, the luminosity can then be determined with an accuracy
        of 0.25 dex or better. (3) We found that the mass-loss rates (&amp;mathaccent
        \\\"705Frelax dot;) of WR stars depend strongly on luminosity and also quite
        strongly on chemical composition. For the combined sample of WN and WC stars

        than adopted in evolutionary calculations, by about 0.2 to 0.6 dex, depending
        on the composition and on the evolutionary calculations. For H-rich WN stars
        the new mass-loss rates are 0.3 dex smaller than adopted in the evolutionary
        calculations of Meynet et al. (1994). (5) The lower mass-loss rates, derived
        in this paper compared to previously adopted values, facilitate the formation
        of black holes as end points of the evolution of massive stars. However they

        in the range of 9 to 120 M<SUB>sun</SUB> at solar metallicity. The following
        effects of rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations
        for non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with
        rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal turbulence,
        shear instability and coupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion
        of angular momentum treated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion
        of the chemical elements. Globally we find that for massive stars the effects
        of rotation have an importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional
        circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in 1-2%
        of the MS lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then slowly evolves
        during the MS phase. The circulation shows two main cells. In the deep interior,
        circulation rises along the polar axis and goes down at the equator, while
        due to the Gratton-\xD6pik term it is the inverse in outer layers. This external
        inverse circulation grows in depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that
        a stationary approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation
        would be inappropriate. After the MS phase, the effects of core contraction
        and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum. The
        surface velocities decrease very much during the MS evolution of the most
        massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a lot of angular
        momentum. This produces some convergence of the velocities, but not necessarily
        towards the break-up velocities. However, stars with masses below ~ 12 M<SUB>sun</SUB>
        with initially high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near
        the end of the MS phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some
        other interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out.
        For an average rotation, the tracks in the HR diagram are modified like a
        moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may increase
        the MS lifetime up to about 30%; for the helium-burning phase the effects
        are smaller and amount to at most 10%. From plots of the isochrones, we find
        that rotation may increase the age estimate by about 25% in general. However,
        for stars with M &gt;~ 40 M<SUB>sun</SUB> and fast rotation, a bluewards ``homogeneous-like''
        track, with important He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting
        the age estimates for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large
        scatter in the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g_eff and log T_eff,
        differences of masses by 30% may easily occur, thus explaining what still
        remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings significant
        surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher masses and rotation.
        While it is not difficult to explain very fast rotators with He- and N-excesses,
        the present models also well account for the many OB stars exhibiting surface
        enrichments and moderate or low rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. \\\\cite{He92},
        \\\\cite{He20}). These stars likely result from initially fast rotators, which
        experienced mixing and lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass
        loss. The comparison of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports
        the conclusion by Venn (\\\\cite{ve95a}, \\\\cite{Ve99}), that these enrichments

        systems and will interact with a companion during their lifetimes, which helps
        to explain the observed diversity of core-collapse supernovae. Donor stars
        in binary systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass
        transfer. As a result, not only are the surface properties affected, but so
        is the core structure. However, most calculations of the core-collapse properties
        of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study
        of the difference between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and
        stars of the same initial mass (11-21 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) that have been stripped
        due to stable post-main-sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present
        the pre-supernova core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive
        representation of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies,
        at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain
        an extended gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer remains until
        core collapse and is more extended in mass for higher initial stellar masses.
        It originates from the receding of the convective helium core during core
        helium burning in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star
        models. We find that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences
        in the final density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped
        star models have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment
        of core collapse compared to single-star models, which likely results in systematically
        different supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning
        and oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications
        of our findings for the \\\"explodability\\\", supernova observations, and
        nucleosynthesis of these stars. Our models are publicly available and can

        recently calculated models for massive stellar evolution and supernovae coupled
        to a model for Galactic chemical evolution, neutron star and black hole birth
        functions (number of neutron stars and black holes as a function of their
        mass) are determined for the Milky Way galaxy. For those stars that explode
        as Type II supernovae, the models give birth functions that are bimodal with
        peaks at 1.27 and 1.76 M<SUB>sun</SUB> and average masses within those peaks
        of 1.28 and 1.73 M<SUB>0</SUB>. For these stars that explode as Type Ib there
        is a narrower spread of remnant masses, the average being 1.32 M<SUB>sun</SUB>,
        and less evidence for bimodality. These values will be increased, especially
        in the more massive Type II supernovae, if significant accretion continues
        during the initial launching of the shock, and the number of heavier neutron
        stars could be depleted by black hole formation. The principal reason for
        the dichotomy in remnant masses for Type II is the difference in the presupernova
        structure of stars above and below 19 M<SUB>sun</SUB>, the mass separating
        stars that burn carbon convectively from those that produce less carbon and
        burn radiatively. The Type Ib's and the lower mass group of the Type II's
        compare favorably with measured neutron star masses, and in particular to
        the Thorsett et al. (1993) determination of the average neutron star mass
        in 17 systems 1.35\xB10.27 M<SUB>sun</SUB>. Variations in the exponent of
        a Salpeter initial mass function are shown not to affect the locations of
        the two peaks in the distribution function, but do affect their relative amplitudes.
        Sources of uncertainty, in particular placement of the mass cut and sensitivity
        to the explosion energy, are discussed, and estimates of the total number
        of neutron stars and black holes in the Galaxy are given. Accretion-induced
        collapse should give a unique gravitational mass of 1.27 M<SUB>sun</SUB>,
        although this could increase if accretion onto the newly formed star continues.
        A similar mass will typify stars in the 8-11 M<SUB>sun</SUB> range (e.g.,
        the Crab pulsar). The lightest neutron star produced is 1.15 M<SUB>sun</SUB>
        for the Type II models and 1.22 M<SUB>sun</SUB> for the Type Ib models. Altogether

        era of large transient surveys, gravitational-wave observatories, and multi-messenger
        astronomy has opened up new possibilities for our understanding of the evolution
        and final fate of massive stars. Most massive stars are born in binary or
        higher-order multiple systems and exchange mass with a companion star during
        their lives. In particular, the progenitors of a large fraction of compact-object
        mergers, and Galactic neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) have been
        stripped of their envelopes by a binary companion. Here, we study the evolution
        of single and stripped binary stars up to core collapse with the stellar evolution
        code MESA and their final fates with a parametric supernova (SN) model. We
        find that stripped binary stars can have systematically different pre-SN structures
        compared to genuine single stars and thus also different SN outcomes. These
        differences are already established by the end of core helium burning and
        are preserved up to core collapse. Consequently, we find that Case A and B
        stripped stars and single and Case C stripped stars develop qualitatively
        similar pre-SN core structures. We find a non-monotonic pattern of NS and
        BH formation as a function of CO core mass that is different in single and
        stripped binary stars. In terms of initial mass, single stars of \u227335
        M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> all form BHs, while this transition is only at about 70
        M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> in stripped stars. On average, stripped stars give rise
        to lower NS and BH masses, higher explosion energies, higher kick velocities,
        and higher nickel yields. Within a simplified population-synthesis model,
        we show that our results lead to a significant reduction in the rates of BH-NS
        and BH-BH mergers with respect to typical assumptions made on NS and BH formation.
        Therefore, our models predict lower detection rates of such merger events
        with for example the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
        (LIGO) than is often considered. Further, we show how certain features in
        the NS-BH mass distribution of single and stripped stars relate to the chirp-mass
        distribution of compact object mergers. Further implications of our findings
        are discussed with respect to the missing red-supergiant problem, a possible

        the combined effect of metallicity, mass loss, and rotation for a large grid

        have been suggested: asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and massive stars
        rotating near the break-up limit (spin stars). We propose massive binaries
        as an alternative source of processed material. We compute the evolution of
        a 20 {M}<SUB>\u2299</SUB> star in a close binary considering the effects of
        non conservative mass and angular momentum transfer and of rotation and tidal

        similar to the abundance patterns observed in gobular cluster stars. However,
        Mg is not significantly depleted in the ejecta of this model. In contrast
        to the fast, radiatively driven winds of massive stars, this material is typically
        ejected with low velocity. We expect that it remains inside the potential

        components, and of single helium stars with initial masses of 2.8-20 M <SUB>sun</SUB>.
        We find that, despite the impact of tidal interaction on the rotation of primary
        stars, the amount of angular momentum retained in the core at the presupernova
        stage in different binary model sequences converges to a value similar to
        those found in previous single star models. This amount is large enough to
        produce millisecond pulsars, but too small to produce magnetars or long gamma-ray
        bursts. We employ the most up-to-date estimate for the Wolf-Rayet mass-loss
        rate, and its implications for SN Ib/c progenitors are discussed in detail.
        In terms of stellar structure, SN Ib/c progenitors in binary systems at solar
        metallicity are predicted to have a wide range of final masses up to about
        7 M <SUB>sun</SUB>, with helium envelopes of M <SUB>He</SUB> ~= 0.16-1.5 M

        &lt;~ 0.5), the distribution of both initial and final masses of SN Ic progenitors
        should be bimodal. Furthermore, we find that a thin hydrogen layer (0.001

        to be present in many SN Ib progenitors at the presupernova stage. We show
        that the presence of hydrogen, together with a rather thick helium envelope,
        can lead to a significant expansion of some SN Ib/c progenitors by the time
        of supernova explosion. This may have important consequences for the shock
        break-out and supernova light curve. We also argue that some SN progenitors
        with thin hydrogen layers produced via Case AB/B transfer might be related

        surface properties, interior structure, and metal enrichment. We produce a

        to an earlier CNO boost to the H shell during He-burning, which may hinder

        their lifetimes that can alter both the surface and core structure of the
        stripped star with significant effects on their ultimate fate as core-collapse
        supernovae. However, core-collapse supernovae simulations to date have focused
        almost exclusively on the evolution of single stars. We present a systematic
        simulation study of single and binary-stripped stars with the same initial
        mass as candidates for core-collapse supernovae (11-21 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>).
        Generally, we find that binary-stripped stars core tend to have a smaller
        compactness parameter, with a more prominent, deeper silicon/oxygen interface,
        and explode preferentially to the corresponding single stars of the same initial
        mass. Such a dichotomy of behavior between these two modes of evolution would
        have important implications for supernovae statistics, including the final
        neutron star masses, explosion energies, and nucleosynthetic yields. Binary-stripped
        remnants are also well poised to populate the possible mass gap between the
        heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes. Our work presents an
        improvement along two fronts, as we self-consistently account for the pre-collapse
        stellar evolution and the subsequent explosion outcome. Even so, our results
        emphasize the need for more detailed stellar evolutionary models to capture
        the sensitive nature of explosion outcome.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Vartanyan,

        .Models of very low Z experience a much stronger internal mixing in all phases
        than at solar Z. Also, rotating models at very low Z, contrary to the usual
        considerations, show a large mass loss, which mainly results from the efficient
        mixing of the products of the 3\u03B1 reaction into the H-burning shell. This
        mixing allows convective dredge-up to enrich the stellar surface in heavy
        elements during the red supergiant phase, which in turn favours a large loss
        of mass by stellar winds, especially as rotation also increases the duration
        of this phase. On the whole, the low Z stars may lose about half of their
        mass. Massive stars initially rotating at half of their critical velocity
        are likely to avoid the pair-instability supernova. The chemical composition

        binaries that merge as compact objects are the progenitors of gravitational-wave
        sources. Most of these binaries experience one or more phases of mass transfer,
        during which one of the stars loses all or part of its outer envelope and
        becomes a stripped-envelope star. The evolution of the size of these stripped
        stars is crucial in determining whether they experience further interactions

        We further discuss their pre-supernova observable characteristics and potential
        consequences of their evolution on the properties of supernovae from stripped
        stars. At high metallicity, we find that practically all of the hydrogen-rich
        envelope is removed, which is in agreement with earlier findings. Only progenitors
        with initial masses below 10 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> expand to large radii (up

        At low metallicity, a substantial amount of hydrogen remains and the progenitors
        can, in principle, expand to giant sizes (&gt; 400 R<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) for
        all masses we consider. This implies that they can fill their Roche lobe anew.

        important at low metallicity, when mass loss by stellar winds diminishes and
        the surface enrichment due to rotational mixing becomes relatively more pronounced
        than at high metallicities. Here we investigate the impact of rotation and
        metallicity on stellar evolution. Using similar physics as in our previous
        large grids of models at Z = 0.002 and Z = 0.014, we compute stellar evolution
        models with the Geneva code for rotating and nonrotating stars with initial
        masses (M<SUB>ini</SUB>) between 1.7 and 120 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> and Z = 0.0004
        (1/35 solar). This is comparable to the metallicities of the most metal poor
        galaxies observed so far, such as I Zw 18. Concerning massive stars, both
        rotating and nonrotating models spend most of their core-helium burning phase
        with an effective temperature higher than 8000 K. Stars become red supergiants
        only at the end of their lifetimes, and few red supergiants are expected.
        Our models predict very few to no classical Wolf-Rayet stars as a results
        of weak stellar winds at low metallicity. The most massive stars end their
        lifetimes as luminous blue supergiants or luminous blue variables, a feature
        that is not predicted by models with higher initial metallicities. Interestingly,
        due to the behavior of the intermediate convective zone, the mass domain of
        stars producing pair-instability supernovae is smaller at Z = 0.0004 than
        at Z = 0.002. We find that during the main sequence (MS) phase, the ratio
        between nitrogen and carbon abundances (N/C) remains unchanged for nonrotating
        models. However, N/C increases by factors of 10-20 in rotating models at the
        end of the MS. Cepheids coming from stars with M<SUB>ini</SUB> &gt; 4 - 6

        15, 20, 25, 40 and 60 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> were computed from the ZAMS until
        the end of the core silicon burning phase. We took into account meridional
        circulation, secular shear instabilities, horizontal turbulence and dynamical
        shear instabilities. We find that dynamical shear instabilities mainly smoothen
        the sharp angular velocity gradients but do not transport angular momentum
        or chemical species over long distances. Most of the differences between the
        pre-supernova structures obtained from rotating and non-rotating stellar models
        have their origin in the effects of rotation during the core hydrogen and
        helium burning phases. The advanced stellar evolutionary stages appear too
        short in time to allow the rotational instabilities considered in this work
        to have a significant impact during the late stages. In particular, the internal

        We emphasize that in binaries the critical initial mass limits for neutron

        Short-lived massive stars are generally considered as the main stellar sources.
        We examine the potential role of less massive stars that lose their envelope
        through interaction with a binary companion. Here, we focus on the role of
        metallicity (Z). For this purpose we used the evolutionary code MESA and created
        tailored atmosphere models with the radiative transfer code CMFGEN. We show
        that typical progenitors, with initial masses of 12 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, produce
        hot and compact stars ( 4 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, 60-80 kK, 1 R<SUB>\u2299</SUB>).
        These stripped stars copiously produce ionizing photons, emitting 60-85% and
        30-60% of their energy as HI and HeI ionizing radiation, for Z = 0.0001-0.02,
        respectively. Their output is comparable to what massive stars emit during
        their Wolf-Rayet phase, if we account for their longer lifetimes and the favorable
        slope of the initial mass function. Their relative importance for reionization
        may be further favored since they emit their photons with a time delay ( 20
        Myr after birth in our fiducial model). This allows time for the dispersal
        of the birth clouds, allowing the ionizing photons to escape into the intergalactic
        medium. At low Z, we find that Roche stripping fails to fully remove the H-rich
        envelope, because of the reduced opacity in the subsurface layers. This is
        in sharp contrast with the assumption of complete stripping that is made in
        rapid population synthesis simulations, which are widely used to simulate
        the binary progenitors of supernovae and gravitational waves. Finally, we

        that show little or no hydrogen comprise roughly one-third of the observed
        explosions of massive stars. Their origin and the evolution of their progenitors
        are not yet fully understood. Very massive single stars stripped by their
        own winds (\u227325\u221230 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> at solar metallicity) are considered
        viable progenitors of these events. However, recent 1D core-collapse simulations
        show that some massive stars may collapse directly into black holes after
        a failed explosion, with a weak or no visible transient. In this Letter, we
        estimate the effect of direct collapse into a black hole on the rates of stripped-envelope
        supernovae that arise from single stars. For this, we compute single-star
        MESA models at solar metallicity and map their final state to their core-collapse
        outcome following prescriptions commonly used in population synthesis. According
        to our models, no single stars that have lost their entire hydrogen-rich envelope
        are able to explode, and only a fraction of progenitors left with a thin hydrogen
        envelope do (IIb progenitor candidates), unless we use a prescription that
        takes the effect of turbulence into account or invoke increased wind mass-loss
        rates. This result increases the existing tension between the single-star
        paradigm to explain most stripped-envelope supernovae and their observed rates
        and properties. At face value, our results point toward an even higher contribution
        of binary progenitors to stripped-envelope supernovae. Alternatively, they
        may suggest inconsistencies in the common practice of mapping different stellar
        models to core-collapse outcomes and/or higher overall mass loss in massive

        important in many fields of astrophysics including nucleosynthesis, stellar
        structure, evolution of galaxies, and formation of planetary systems. Still,
        our knowledge of the abundances of these elements in different stellar populations
        is uncertain because of difficulties in observing and analyzing atomic and
        molecular lines of C and O. <BR /> Aims: Abundances of C, O, and Fe are determined
        for F and G main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood with metallicities
        in the range -1.6 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; +0.4 in order to study trends and possible
        systematic differences in the C/Fe, O/Fe, and C/O ratios for thin- and thick-disk
        stars as well as high- and low-alpha halo stars. In addition, we investigate
        if there is any connection between C and O abundances in stellar atmospheres
        and the occurrence of planets. <BR /> Methods: Carbon abundances are determined
        from the \u03BB\u03BB 5052,5380 C i lines and oxygen abundances from the \u03BB7774
        O i triplet and the forbidden [O i] line at 6300 \xC5. MARCS model atmospheres

        and between thin- and thick-disk stars are seen in the trends of [C/Fe] and
        [O/Fe]. The two halo populations and thick-disk stars show the same trend
        of [C/O] versus [O/H], whereas the thin-disk stars are shifted to higher [C/O]
        values. Furthermore, we find some evidence of higher C/O and C/Fe ratios in
        stars hosting planets than in stars for which no planets have been detected.
        <BR /> Conclusions: The results suggest that C and O in both high- and low-alpha
        halo stars and in thick-disk stars are made mainly in massive (M&gt; 8 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>)
        stars, whereas thin-disk stars have an additional carbon contribution from
        low-mass AGB and massive stars of high metallicity causing a rising trend
        of the C/O ratio with increasing metallicity. However, at the highest metallicities
        investigated ([Fe/H] \u2243 + 0.4), C/O does not exceed 0.8, which seems to
        exclude formation of carbon planets if proto-planetary disks have the same

        loss processes are a key uncertainty in the evolution of massive stars. They
        determine the amount of mass and angular momentum retained by the star, thus
        influencing its evolution and presupernova structure. Because of the high
        complexity of the physical processes driving mass loss, stellar evolution
        calculations must employ parametric algorithms, and usually only include wind
        mass loss. We carried out an extensive parameter study of wind mass loss and
        its effects on massive star evolution using the open-source stellar evolution
        code MESA. We provide a systematic comparison of wind mass loss algorithms
        for solar-metallicity, nonrotating, single stars in the initial mass range
        of 15 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> to 35 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. We consider combinations
        drawn from two hot phase (I.e., roughly the main sequence) algorithms, three
        cool phase (I.e., post-main-sequence) algorithms, and two Wolf-Rayet mass
        loss algorithms. We discuss separately the effects of mass loss in each of
        these phases. In addition, we consider linear wind efficiency scale factors
        of 1, 0.33, and 0.1 to account for suggested reductions in mass loss rates
        due to wind inhomogeneities. We find that the initial to final mass mapping
        for each zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass has a 50% uncertainty if all algorithm
        combinations and wind efficiencies are considered. The ad-hoc efficiency scale
        factor dominates this uncertainty. While the final total mass and internal
        structure of our models vary tremendously with mass loss treatment, final
        luminosity and effective temperature are much less sensitive for stars with
        ZAMS mass \u2272 30 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. This indicates that uncertainty in
        wind mass loss does not negatively affect estimates of the ZAMS mass of most
        single-star supernova progenitors from pre-explosion observations. Our results
        furthermore show that the internal structure of presupernova stars is sensitive
        to variations in both main sequence and post main-sequence mass loss. The
        compactness parameter \u03BE \u221D \u2133 /R(\u2133) has been identified
        as a proxy for the \\\"explodability\\\" of a given presupernova model. We
        find that \u03BE varies by as much as 30% for models of the same ZAMS mass
        evolved with different wind efficiencies and mass loss algorithm combinations.
        This suggests that the details of the mass loss treatment might bias the outcome
        of detailed core-collapse supernova calculations and the predictions for neutron

        early B-type stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and found several groups
        of stars that have chemical compositions that conflict with the theory of
        rotational mixing. Here we extend this study to Galactic and Small Magellanic
        Cloud (SMC) metallicities. <BR />Methods: We provide chemical compositions
        for ~50 Galactic and ~100 SMC early B-type stars and compare these to the
        LMC results. These samples cover a range of projected rotational velocities
        up to ~300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and hence are well suited to testing rotational
        mixing models. The surface nitrogen abundances are utilised as a probe of
        the mixing process since nitrogen is synthesized in the core of the stars
        and mixed to the surface. <BR />Results: In the SMC, we find a population
        of slowly rotating nitrogen-rich stars amongst the early B type core-hydrogen
        burning stars, which is comparable to that found previously in the LMC. The
        identification of non-enriched rapid rotators in the SMC is not possible due
        to the relatively high upper limits on the nitrogen abundance for the fast
        rotators. In the Galactic sample we find no significant enrichment amongst
        the core hydrogen-burning stars, which appears to be in contrast with the
        expectation from both rotating single-star and close binary evolution models.
        However, only a small number of the rapidly rotating stars have evolved enough
        to produce a significant nitrogen enrichment, and these may be analogous to
        the non-enriched rapid rotators previously found in the LMC sample. Finally,
        in each metallicity regime, a population of highly enriched supergiants is
        observed, which cannot be the immediate descendants of core-hydrogen burning
        stars. Their abundances are, however, compatible with them having gone through
        a previous red supergiant phase. Together, these observations paint a complex
        picture of the nitrogen enrichment in massive main sequence and supergiant
        stellar atmospheres, where age and binarity cause crucial effects. Whether
        rotational mixing is required to understand our results remains an open question
        at this time, but could be answered by identifying the true binary fraction
        in those groups of stars that do not agree with single-star evolutionary models.

        g &lt; 3.7 dex) fast rotators that are relatively unenriched (a further ~20%

        transfer to the secondary the primary component of initial mass 16 M_odot

        primary (now the less massive component should settle down near the main sequence

        trends of chemical abundances and abundance ratios observed in stars of different

        in 34 F and G dwarf and subgiant stars belonging to the halo population and
        spanning a range of metallicity from [Fe/H] = -0.7 to -3.2 . The survey is
        based on observations of four permitted lines of C I near 9100 \xC5 and the
        O I,\u03BB 7774 triplet, all recorded at high signal-to-noise ratios with
        the UVES echelle spectrograph on the ESO VLT. The line equivalent widths were
        analysed with the 1D, LTE, MARCS model atmosphere code to deduce C and O abundances;
        corrections due to non-LTE and 3D effects are discussed. When combined with
        similar published data for disk stars, our results confirm the metallicity
        dependence of the C/O ratio known from previous stellar and interstellar studies:
        C/O drops by a factor of \u223C3-4 as O/H decreases from solar to \u223C1/10
        solar. Analysed within the context of standard models for the chemical evolution
        of the solar vicinity, this drop results from the metallicity dependence of
        the C yields from massive stars with mass loss, augmented by the delayed release
        of C from stars of low and intermediate mass. The former is, however, always
        the dominant factor. Our survey has also uncovered tentative evidence to suggest
        that, as the oxygen abundance decreases below [O/H] = -1, [C/O] may not remain
        constant at [C/O] = -0.5, as previously thought, but increase again, possibly
        approaching near-solar values at the lowest metallicities ([O/H] \u2272 -3).
        With the current dataset this is no more than a 3\u03C3 effect and it may
        be due to metallicity-dependent non-LTE corrections to the [C/O] ratio which
        have not been taken into account. However, its potential importance as a window
        on the nucleosynthesis by Population III stars is a strong incentive for future
        work, both observational and theoretical, to verify its reality. <P />Based

        physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics.
        Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open
        source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications
        in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution
        module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations
        of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass
        to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves
        the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses
        adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports
        shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide
        equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data,
        and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate
        Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate
        independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive
        verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the
        wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary
        tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very
        old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M <SUB>sun</SUB> star from
        the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed
        profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning
        phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase;
        the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the
        complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of
        core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and
        the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star. MESA can be downloaded
        from the project Web site (<A href=\\\"http://mesa.sourceforge.net/\\\">http://mesa.sourceforge.net/</A>).\",\n

        nucleosynthetic yield of isotopes lighter than A = 66 (zinc) is determined
        for a grid of stellar masses and metallicities including stars of 11, 12,

        Z = 0, l0<SUP>-4</SUP>, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 times solar (a slightly reduced mass
        grid is employed for nonsolar metallicities). Altogether 78 different model
        supernova explosions are calculated. In each case nucleosynthesis has already
        been determined for 200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the presupernova
        star, including the effects of time dependent convection. Here each star is
        exploded using a piston to give a specified final kinetic energy at infinity
        (typically 1.2 \xD7 10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs), and the explosive modifications
        to the nucleosynthesis, including the effects of neutrino irradiation, determined.
        A single value of the critical <SUP>12</SUP>C(\u03B1,\u03B3) <SUP>16</SUP>O
        reaction rate corresponding to 8(300 keV) = 170 keV barns is used in all calculations.
        The synthesis of each isotope is discussed along with its sensitivity to model
        parameters. In each case, the final mass of the collapsed remnant is also
        determined and often found not to correspond to the location of the piston
        (typically the edge of the iron core), but to a \\\"mass cut\\\" farther out.
        This mass cut is sensitive not only to the explosion energy, but also to the
        presupernova structure, stellar mass, and the metallicity. Unless the explosion
        mechanism, for unknown reasons, provides a much larger characteristic energy
        in more massive stars, it appears likely that stars larger than about 30 M<SUB>sun</SUB>
        will experience considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the initial
        launch of a successful shock. While such explosions will produce a viable,
        bright Type II supernova light curve, lacking perhaps the radioactive tail,
        they will have dramatically reduced yields of heavy elements and may leave
        black hole remnants of up to 10 and more solar masses. The production of black
        holes may be particularly favored for stars of low metallicity, both because

        model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to
        masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology
        enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling
        of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates
        a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented

        /> Aims: Many topical astrophysical research areas, such as the properties
        of planet host stars, the nature of the progenitors of different types of
        supernovae and gamma ray bursts, and the evolution of galaxies, require complete
        and homogeneous sets of stellar models at different metallicities in order
        to be studied during the whole of cosmic history. We present here a first
        set of models for solar metallicity, where the effects of rotation are accounted
        for in a homogeneous way. <BR /> Methods: We computed a grid of 48 different
        stellar evolutionary tracks, both rotating and non-rotating, at Z = 0.014,
        spanning a wide mass range from 0.8 to 120 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. For each of
        the stellar masses considered, electronic tables provide data for 400 stages
        along the evolutionary track and at each stage, a set of 43 physical data
        are given. These grids thus provide an extensive and detailed data basis for
        comparisons with the observations. The rotating models start on the zero-age
        main sequence (ZAMS) with a rotation rate \u03C5<SUB>ini</SUB>/\u03C5<SUB>crit</SUB>
        = 0.4. The evolution is computed until the end of the central carbon-burning
        phase, the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, or the core helium-flash
        for, respectively, the massive, intermediate, and both low and very low mass
        stars. The initial abundances are those deduced by Asplund and collaborators,
        which best fit the observed abundances of massive stars in the solar neighbourhood.
        We update both the opacities and nuclear reaction rates, and introduce new
        prescriptions for the mass-loss rates as stars approach the Eddington and/or
        the critical velocity. We account for both atomic diffusion and magnetic braking
        in our low-mass star models. <BR /> Results: The present rotating models provide
        a good description of the average evolution of non-interacting stars. In particular,
        they reproduce the observed main-sequence width, the positions of the red
        giant and supergiant stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, the observed
        surface compositions and rotational velocities. Very interestingly, the enhancement
        of the mass loss during the red-supergiant stage, when the luminosity becomes
        supra-Eddington in some outer layers, help models above 15-20 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>
        to lose a significant part of their hydrogen envelope and evolve back into
        the blue part of the HR diagram. This result has interesting consequences
        for the blue to red supergiant ratio, the minimum mass for stars to become
        Wolf-Rayet stars, and the maximum initial mass of stars that explode as type
        II-P supernovae. <P />Tracks and isochrones are available at the CDS via anonymous

        10. The calculation of this grid completes the Vink et al. (2000) mass-loss
        recipe with an additional parameter Z. We have found that the exponent of
        the power law dependence of mass loss vs. metallicity is constant in the range
        between 1/30 &lt;= Z/Z<SUB>sun</SUB> &lt;= 3. The mass-loss rate scales as

        stars with T_eff &gt;~ 25 000 K, and p = -1.60 for the B supergiants with

        Z<SUP>0.13</SUP> from Leitherer et al. (1992), the overall result of mass

        mass loss vs. metallicity dependence is constant over a large range in Z,
        one should be aware of the presence of bi-stability jumps at specific temperatures.
        Here the character of the line driving changes drastically due to recombinations
        of dominant metal species resulting in jumps in the mass loss. We have investigated
        the physical origins of these jumps and have derived formulae that combine
        mass loss recipes for both sides of such jumps. As observations of different
        galaxies show that the ratio Fe/O varies with metallicity, we make a distinction
        between the metal abundance Z derived on the basis of iron or oxygen lines.
        Our mass-loss predictions are successful in explaining the observed mass-loss
        rates for Galactic and Small Magellanic Cloud O-type stars, as well as in
        predicting the observed Galactic bi-stability jump. Hence, we believe that
        our predictions are reliable and suggest that our mass-loss recipe be used

        After combining the samples from the various surveys and correcting for their
        respective selection effects, we find that the properties of companions to

        at short orbital periods P \u2272 20 days (separations a \u2272 0.4 au), the
        binaries have small eccentricities e \u2272 0.4, favor modest mass ratios
        &lt; q&gt; \u2248 0.5, and exhibit a small excess of twins q &gt; 0.95. Second,
        the companion frequency peaks at intermediate periods log P (days) \u2248
        3.5 (a \u2248 10 au), where the binaries have mass ratios weighted toward
        small values q \u2248 0.2-0.3 and follow a Maxwellian \u201Cthermal\u201D
        eccentricity distribution. Finally, companions with long orbital periods log
        P (days) \u2248 5.5-7.5 (a \u2248 200-5000 au) are outer tertiary components

        mass function. We discuss these companion distributions and properties in

        numerous AGN host-galaxies out to z \u223C 7, highly star-forming submillimeter
        galaxies, and increasing samples of main-sequence color-selected star-forming
        galaxies at z \u223C 1.5 to 2.5. Studies have moved well beyond simple detections
        to dynamical imaging at kiloparsec-scale resolution and multiline, multispecies
        studies that determine the physical conditions in the ISM in early galaxies.
        Observations of the cool gas are the required complement to studies of the
        stellar density and star-formation history of the Universe as they reveal
        the phase of the ISM that immediately precedes star formation in galaxies.
        Current observations suggest that the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic
        star-formation rate density from z \u223C 0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar
        increase in the gas-to-stellar mass ratio in star-forming disk galaxies. Progress
        has been made in determining the CO luminosity to H<SUB>2</SUB> mass conversion
        factor at high z, and the dichotomy between high versus low values for main-sequence
        versus starburst galaxies, respectively, appears to persist with increasing
        redshift, with a likely dependence on metallicity and other local physical
        conditions. There may also be two sequences in the relationship between star-formation
        rate and gas mass: one for starbursts, in which the gas consumption timescale
        is short (a few 10<SUP>7</SUP> years), and one for main sequence galaxies,
        with an order of magnitude longer gas consumption timescale. Studies of atomic
        FSL emission are rapidly progressing, with some tens of galaxies detected
        in the exceptionally bright [Cii] 158-\u03BCm line to date. The [Cii] line
        is proving to be a unique tracer of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe
        and, together with other atomic FSLs, has the potential to be the most direct
        means of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the first galaxies during cosmic
        reionization.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Carilli, C. L.\",\n          \"Walter,

        of the interstellar medium in disk galaxies is in the form of neutral atomic
        hydrogen, H I. This gas can be in thermal equilibrium at relatively low temperatures,
        T&lt;~300 K (the cold neutral medium [CNM]), or at temperatures somewhat less
        than 10<SUP>4</SUP> K (the warm neutral medium [WNM]). These two phases can
        coexist over a narrow range of pressures, P<SUB>min</SUB>&lt;=P&lt;=P<SUB>max</SUB>.
        We determine P<SUB>min</SUB> and P<SUB>max</SUB> in the plane of the Galaxy
        as a function of Galactocentric radius R using recent determinations of the
        gas heating rate and the gas-phase abundances of interstellar gas. We provide
        an analytic approximation for P<SUB>min</SUB> as a function of metallicity,
        far-ultraviolet radiation field, and the ionization rate of atomic hydrogen.
        Our analytic results show that the existence of P<SUB>min</SUB>, or the possibility
        of a two-phase equilibrium, generally requires that H<SUP>+</SUP> exceed C<SUP>+</SUP>
        in abundance at P<SUB>min</SUB>. The abundance of H<SUP>+</SUP> is set by
        EUV/soft X-ray photoionization and by recombination with negatively charged
        polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In order to assess whether thermal or pressure
        equilibrium is a realistic assumption, we define a parameter \u03A5\u2261t<SUB>cool</SUB>/t<SUB>shock</SUB>,
        where t<SUB>cool</SUB> is the gas cooling time and t<SUB>shock</SUB> is the
        characteristic shock time or ``time between shocks in a turbulent medium.''
        For \u03A5&lt;1 gas has time to reach thermal balance between supernova-induced
        shocks. We find that this condition is satisfied in the Galactic disk, and
        thus the two-phase description of the interstellar H I is approximately valid
        even in the presence of interstellar turbulence. Observationally, the mean
        density HI&gt; is often better determined than the local density, and we cast
        our results in terms of HI&gt; as well. Over most of the disk of the Galaxy,
        the H I must be in two phases: the weight of the H I in the gravitational
        potential of the Galaxy is large enough to generate thermal pressures exceeding
        P<SUB>min</SUB>, so that turbulent pressure fluctuations can produce cold
        gas that is thermally stable; and the mean density of the H I is too low for
        the gas to be all CNM. Our models predict the presence of CNM gas to R~=16-18
        kpc, somewhat farther than previous estimates. An estimate for the typical
        thermal pressure in the Galactic plane for 3kpc&lt;~R&lt;~18 kpc is P<SUB>th</SUB>/k~=1.4\xD710<SUP>4</SUP>exp(-R/5.5kpc)
        K cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. At the solar circle, this gives P<SUB>th</SUB>/k~=3000

        found by Heiles &amp; Troland. We also examine the potential impact of turbulent
        heating on our results and provide parameterized expressions for the heating
        rate as a function of Galactic radius. Although the uncertainties are large,
        our models predict that including turbulent heating does not significantly

        present a quantitative model for the infrared emission from dust in the diffuse
        interstellar medium. The model consists of a mixture of amorphous silicate
        grains and carbonaceous grains, each with a wide size distribution ranging
        from molecules containing tens of atoms to large grains &gt;~1 \u03BCm in
        diameter. We assume that the carbonaceous grains have properties like polycyclic
        aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at very small sizes and graphitic properties
        for radii a&gt;~50 \xC5. On the basis of recent laboratory studies and guided
        by astronomical observations, we propose ``astronomical'' absorption cross
        sections for use in modeling neutral and ionized PAHs from the far-ultraviolet
        to the far-infrared. We also propose modifications to the far-infrared emissivity
        of ``astronomical silicate.'' We calculate energy distribution functions for
        small grains undergoing ``temperature spikes'' caused by stochastic absorption
        of starlight photons using realistic heat capacities and optical properties.
        Using a grain-size distribution consistent with the observed interstellar
        extinction, we are able to reproduce the near-IR to submillimeter emission
        spectrum of the diffuse interstellar medium, including the PAH emission features
        at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 \u03BCm. The model is compared with the observed
        emission at high Galactic latitudes as well as in the Galactic plane, as measured
        by the COBE/DIRBE, COBE/FIRAS, IRTS/MIRS, and IRTS/NIRS instruments. The model
        has 60\xD710<SUP>-6</SUP> of C (relative to H) locked up in PAHs, with 45\xD710<SUP>-6</SUP>
        of C in a component peaking at ~6 \xC5 (N<SUB>C</SUB>~100 carbon atoms) to
        account for the PAH emission features and with 15\xD710<SUP>-6</SUP> of C

        mass-loss rates of 64 Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are used to study the
        dependence of mass-loss rates, momentum transfer efficiencies and terminal
        velocities on the basic stellar parameters and chemical composition. The luminosities
        of the WR stars have been determined either directly from the masses, using
        the dependence of L on mass predicted by stellar evolution theory, or they
        were determined from the absolute visual magnitudes and the bolometric corrections.
        For this purpose we improved the relation between the bolometric correction
        and the spectral subclass. (1) The momentum transfer efficiencies \u03B7 (i.e.
        the ratio between the wind momentum loss and radiative momentum loss) of WR
        stars are found to lie in the range of 1.4 to 17.6, with the mean value of
        6.2 for the 64 program stars. Such values can probably be explained by radiative
        driving due to multiple scattering of photons in a WR wind with an ionization
        stratification. However, there may be a problem in explaining the driving
        at low velocities. (2) We derived the linear regression relations for the
        dependence of the terminal velocity, the momentum transfer efficiency and
        the mass-loss rates on luminosity and chemical composition. We found a tight
        relation between the terminal velocity of the wind and the parameters of the
        hydrostatic core. This relation enables the determination of the mass of the
        WR stars from their observed terminal velocities and chemical composition
        with an accuracy of about 0.1 dex for WN and WC stars. Using evolutionary
        models of WR stars, the luminosity can then be determined with an accuracy
        of 0.25 dex or better. (3) We found that the mass-loss rates (&amp;mathaccent
        \\\"705Frelax dot;) of WR stars depend strongly on luminosity and also quite
        strongly on chemical composition. For the combined sample of WN and WC stars
        we found that &amp;mathaccent \\\"705Frelax dot; in M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP>

        of \u03C3 = 0.19 dex (4) The new mass-loss rates are significantly smaller
        than adopted in evolutionary calculations, by about 0.2 to 0.6 dex, depending
        on the composition and on the evolutionary calculations. For H-rich WN stars
        the new mass-loss rates are 0.3 dex smaller than adopted in the evolutionary
        calculations of Meynet et al. (1994). (5) The lower mass-loss rates, derived
        in this paper compared to previously adopted values, facilitate the formation
        of black holes as end points of the evolution of massive stars. However they
        might create a problem in explaining the observed WN/WC ratios, unless rotational

        \       \"abstract\":\"Grids of models for rotating stars are constructed
        in the range of 9 to 120 M<SUB>sun</SUB> at solar metallicity. The following
        effects of rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations
        for non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with
        rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal turbulence,
        shear instability and coupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion
        of angular momentum treated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion
        of the chemical elements. Globally we find that for massive stars the effects
        of rotation have an importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional
        circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in 1-2%
        of the MS lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then slowly evolves
        during the MS phase. The circulation shows two main cells. In the deep interior,
        circulation rises along the polar axis and goes down at the equator, while
        due to the Gratton-\xD6pik term it is the inverse in outer layers. This external
        inverse circulation grows in depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that
        a stationary approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation
        would be inappropriate. After the MS phase, the effects of core contraction
        and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum. The
        surface velocities decrease very much during the MS evolution of the most
        massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a lot of angular
        momentum. This produces some convergence of the velocities, but not necessarily
        towards the break-up velocities. However, stars with masses below ~ 12 M<SUB>sun</SUB>
        with initially high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near
        the end of the MS phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some
        other interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out.
        For an average rotation, the tracks in the HR diagram are modified like a
        moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may increase
        the MS lifetime up to about 30%; for the helium-burning phase the effects
        are smaller and amount to at most 10%. From plots of the isochrones, we find
        that rotation may increase the age estimate by about 25% in general. However,
        for stars with M &gt;~ 40 M<SUB>sun</SUB> and fast rotation, a bluewards ``homogeneous-like''
        track, with important He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting
        the age estimates for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large
        scatter in the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g_eff and log T_eff,
        differences of masses by 30% may easily occur, thus explaining what still
        remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings significant
        surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher masses and rotation.
        While it is not difficult to explain very fast rotators with He- and N-excesses,
        the present models also well account for the many OB stars exhibiting surface
        enrichments and moderate or low rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. \\\\cite{He92},
        \\\\cite{He20}). These stars likely result from initially fast rotators, which
        experienced mixing and lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass
        loss. The comparison of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports
        the conclusion by Venn (\\\\cite{ve95a}, \\\\cite{Ve99}), that these enrichments
        mostly result from mixing during the MS phase, which is also in agreement

        is investigated systematically by means of a Henyey-type stellar evolution
        code that was modified to allow its application to binary stellar evolution

        stage of the supernova progenitor at the time of the interaction. Monte Carlo
        simulations are performed to estimate the frequencies of the occurrence of

        of the choice of nuclear equation of state (EOS), zero-age main sequence (ZAMS)

        We find that the outcome, for a given EOS, can be estimated, to first order,

        protoneutron star (PNS) structure at the onset of gravitational instability
        with solutions of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkof equations, we find that thermal
        pressure support in the outer PNS core is responsible for raising the maximum
        PNS mass by up to 25% above the cold NS value. By artificially increasing
        neutrino heating, we find the critical neutrino heating efficiency required
        for exploding a given progenitor structure and connect these findings with
        ZAMS conditions, establishing, albeit approximately, for the first time based
        on actual collapse simulations, the mapping between ZAMS parameters and the

        systems and will interact with a companion during their lifetimes, which helps
        to explain the observed diversity of core-collapse supernovae. Donor stars
        in binary systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass
        transfer. As a result, not only are the surface properties affected, but so
        is the core structure. However, most calculations of the core-collapse properties
        of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study
        of the difference between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and
        stars of the same initial mass (11-21 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) that have been stripped
        due to stable post-main-sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present
        the pre-supernova core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive
        representation of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies,
        at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain
        an extended gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer remains until
        core collapse and is more extended in mass for higher initial stellar masses.
        It originates from the receding of the convective helium core during core
        helium burning in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star
        models. We find that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences
        in the final density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped
        star models have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment
        of core collapse compared to single-star models, which likely results in systematically
        different supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning
        and oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications
        of our findings for the \\\"explodability\\\", supernova observations, and
        nucleosynthesis of these stars. Our models are publicly available and can

        functions (number of neutron stars and black holes as a function of their
        mass) are determined for the Milky Way galaxy. For those stars that explode
        as Type II supernovae, the models give birth functions that are bimodal with
        peaks at 1.27 and 1.76 M<SUB>sun</SUB> and average masses within those peaks
        of 1.28 and 1.73 M<SUB>0</SUB>. For these stars that explode as Type Ib there
        is a narrower spread of remnant masses, the average being 1.32 M<SUB>sun</SUB>,
        and less evidence for bimodality. These values will be increased, especially
        in the more massive Type II supernovae, if significant accretion continues
        during the initial launching of the shock, and the number of heavier neutron
        stars could be depleted by black hole formation. The principal reason for
        the dichotomy in remnant masses for Type II is the difference in the presupernova
        structure of stars above and below 19 M<SUB>sun</SUB>, the mass separating
        stars that burn carbon convectively from those that produce less carbon and

        the Thorsett et al. (1993) determination of the average neutron star mass
        in 17 systems 1.35\xB10.27 M<SUB>sun</SUB>. Variations in the exponent of
        a Salpeter initial mass function are shown not to affect the locations of

        mass-loss rates of massive helium stars are one of the major uncertainties
        in modern astrophysics. Regardless of whether they were stripped by a binary
        companion or managed to peel off their outer layers by themselves, the influence
        and final fate of helium stars - in particular the resulting black hole mass
        - highly depends on their wind mass-loss as stripped-envelope objects. While
        empirical mass-loss constraints for massive helium stars have improved over
        the last decades, the resulting recipes are limited to metallicities with
        the observational ability to sufficiently resolve individual stars. Yet, theoretical
        efforts have been hampered by the complexity of Wolf-Rayet (WR) winds arising
        from the more massive helium stars. In an unprecedented effort, we calculate
        next-generation stellar atmosphere models resembling massive helium main-sequence
        stars with Fe-bump driven winds up to $500\\\\, \\\\mathrm{M}_\\\\odot$ over
        a wide metallicity range between 2.0 and $0.02\\\\, \\\\mathrm{Z}_\\\\odot$
        . We uncover a complex \u0393<SUB>e</SUB>-dependency of WR-type winds and
        their metallicity-dependent breakdown. The latter can be related to the onset
        of multiple scattering, requiring higher L/M-ratios at lower metallicity.
        Based on our findings, we derive the first ever theoretically motivated mass-loss
        recipe for massive helium stars. We also provide estimates for Lyman continuum
        and $\\\\rm{He\\\\,{\\\\small II}}$ -=ionizing fluxes, finding stripped helium
        stars to contribute considerably at low metallicity. In sharp contrast to
        OB-star winds, the mass-loss for helium stars scales with the terminal velocity.
        While limited to the helium main sequence, our study marks a major step towards
        a better theoretical understanding of helium star evolution.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Sander,

        era of large transient surveys, gravitational-wave observatories, and multi-messenger
        astronomy has opened up new possibilities for our understanding of the evolution
        and final fate of massive stars. Most massive stars are born in binary or
        higher-order multiple systems and exchange mass with a companion star during
        their lives. In particular, the progenitors of a large fraction of compact-object
        mergers, and Galactic neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) have been
        stripped of their envelopes by a binary companion. Here, we study the evolution
        of single and stripped binary stars up to core collapse with the stellar evolution
        code MESA and their final fates with a parametric supernova (SN) model. We
        find that stripped binary stars can have systematically different pre-SN structures
        compared to genuine single stars and thus also different SN outcomes. These
        differences are already established by the end of core helium burning and
        are preserved up to core collapse. Consequently, we find that Case A and B
        stripped stars and single and Case C stripped stars develop qualitatively
        similar pre-SN core structures. We find a non-monotonic pattern of NS and
        BH formation as a function of CO core mass that is different in single and
        stripped binary stars. In terms of initial mass, single stars of \u227335
        M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> all form BHs, while this transition is only at about 70
        M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> in stripped stars. On average, stripped stars give rise
        to lower NS and BH masses, higher explosion energies, higher kick velocities,
        and higher nickel yields. Within a simplified population-synthesis model,
        we show that our results lead to a significant reduction in the rates of BH-NS
        and BH-BH mergers with respect to typical assumptions made on NS and BH formation.
        Therefore, our models predict lower detection rates of such merger events
        with for example the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
        (LIGO) than is often considered. Further, we show how certain features in
        the NS-BH mass distribution of single and stripped stars relate to the chirp-mass
        distribution of compact object mergers. Further implications of our findings
        are discussed with respect to the missing red-supergiant problem, a possible
        mass gap between NSs and BHs, X-ray binaries, and observationally inferred
        nickel masses from Type Ib/c and IIP SNe.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Schneider,

        the combined effect of metallicity, mass loss, and rotation for a large grid

        produce primary F and dominate its solar abundance and we confirm their role

        as an alternative source of processed material. We compute the evolution of
        a 20 {M}<SUB>\u2299</SUB> star in a close binary considering the effects of
        non conservative mass and angular momentum transfer and of rotation and tidal

        Mg is not significantly depleted in the ejecta of this model. In contrast

        We find that, despite the impact of tidal interaction on the rotation of primary

        stage in different binary model sequences converges to a value similar to
        those found in previous single star models. This amount is large enough to

        bursts. We employ the most up-to-date estimate for the Wolf-Rayet mass-loss
        rate, and its implications for SN Ib/c progenitors are discussed in detail.
        In terms of stellar structure, SN Ib/c progenitors in binary systems at solar

        almost exclusively on the evolution of single stars. We present a systematic

        Generally, we find that binary-stripped stars core tend to have a smaller

        have important implications for supernovae statistics, including the final

        remnants are also well poised to populate the possible mass gap between the

        .Models of very low Z experience a much stronger internal mixing in all phases

        mixing allows convective dredge-up to enrich the stellar surface in heavy
        elements during the red supergiant phase, which in turn favours a large loss
        of mass by stellar winds, especially as rotation also increases the duration
        of this phase. On the whole, the low Z stars may lose about half of their

        binaries that merge as compact objects are the progenitors of gravitational-wave
        sources. Most of these binaries experience one or more phases of mass transfer,
        during which one of the stars loses all or part of its outer envelope and
        becomes a stripped-envelope star. The evolution of the size of these stripped
        stars is crucial in determining whether they experience further interactions

        investigate their radius evolution as a function of mass and metallicity.
        We further discuss their pre-supernova observable characteristics and potential
        consequences of their evolution on the properties of supernovae from stripped
        stars. At high metallicity, we find that practically all of the hydrogen-rich
        envelope is removed, which is in agreement with earlier findings. Only progenitors
        with initial masses below 10 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> expand to large radii (up
        to 100 R<SUB>\u2299</SUB>), while more massive progenitors remain compact.
        At low metallicity, a substantial amount of hydrogen remains and the progenitors
        can, in principle, expand to giant sizes (&gt; 400 R<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) for
        all masses we consider. This implies that they can fill their Roche lobe anew.
        We show that the prescriptions commonly used in population synthesis models

        galaxies, where data for multiple isotopologue lines are available, we find
        compelling new evidence for a top-heavy stellar IMF, with profound implications
        for their star formation rates and efficiencies, perhaps also their stellar
        masses. Neither chemical fractionation nor selective photodissociation can
        significantly perturb globally averaged isotopologue abundance ratios away
        from the corresponding isotope ones, as both these processes will typically
        affect only small mass fractions of molecular clouds in galaxies. Thus, the
        Atacama Large Millimeter Array now stands ready to probe the stellar IMF,
        and even the ages of specific starburst events in star-forming galaxies across

        ratios for a massive post-main sequence supergiant having experienced strong
        mass loss. The origin of the variability of the Hubble-Sandage variables is
        discussed in relation with the instability limit (de Jager's limit) for deep
        turbulent external convective zones in supergiants. This limit may also be
        responsible for the fact that the brightest red supergiants are 2 mag fainter

        the surface, what is likely to correspond to the beginning of the WC stage.
        We note then a very steep disappearance of <SUP>13</SUP>C and <SUP>14</SUP>N,
        a very temporary peak of <SUP>18</SUP>O, and above all a vertiginous rise
        by more than 2 orders of magnitude of <SUP>12</SUP>C, <SUP>16</SUP>O, and

        rise strongly, particularly in the most massive WC stars, where s-elements

        C/He, N/He, and C/N ratios and those observed by Smith and Willis (1982) and
        by Nugis (1982) for WNL, WNE, and WC stars. The general agreement strongly
        supports the advanced evolutionary stage of WR stars as left-over cores resulting
        from the peeling of massive stars by stellar winds. If confirmed, the presence
        of <SUP>14</SUP>N in WC stars may bring some indication on mixing. Observations

        important at low metallicity, when mass loss by stellar winds diminishes and
        the surface enrichment due to rotational mixing becomes relatively more pronounced
        than at high metallicities. Here we investigate the impact of rotation and
        metallicity on stellar evolution. Using similar physics as in our previous
        large grids of models at Z = 0.002 and Z = 0.014, we compute stellar evolution
        models with the Geneva code for rotating and nonrotating stars with initial
        masses (M<SUB>ini</SUB>) between 1.7 and 120 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> and Z = 0.0004
        (1/35 solar). This is comparable to the metallicities of the most metal poor
        galaxies observed so far, such as I Zw 18. Concerning massive stars, both
        rotating and nonrotating models spend most of their core-helium burning phase
        with an effective temperature higher than 8000 K. Stars become red supergiants
        only at the end of their lifetimes, and few red supergiants are expected.
        Our models predict very few to no classical Wolf-Rayet stars as a results
        of weak stellar winds at low metallicity. The most massive stars end their
        lifetimes as luminous blue supergiants or luminous blue variables, a feature
        that is not predicted by models with higher initial metallicities. Interestingly,
        due to the behavior of the intermediate convective zone, the mass domain of
        stars producing pair-instability supernovae is smaller at Z = 0.0004 than
        at Z = 0.002. We find that during the main sequence (MS) phase, the ratio
        between nitrogen and carbon abundances (N/C) remains unchanged for nonrotating
        models. However, N/C increases by factors of 10-20 in rotating models at the
        end of the MS. Cepheids coming from stars with M<SUB>ini</SUB> &gt; 4 - 6

        15, 20, 25, 40 and 60 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> were computed from the ZAMS until
        the end of the core silicon burning phase. We took into account meridional
        circulation, secular shear instabilities, horizontal turbulence and dynamical
        shear instabilities. We find that dynamical shear instabilities mainly smoothen
        the sharp angular velocity gradients but do not transport angular momentum
        or chemical species over long distances. Most of the differences between the
        pre-supernova structures obtained from rotating and non-rotating stellar models
        have their origin in the effects of rotation during the core hydrogen and
        helium burning phases. The advanced stellar evolutionary stages appear too
        short in time to allow the rotational instabilities considered in this work
        to have a significant impact during the late stages. In particular, the internal
        angular momentum does not change significantly during the advanced stages

        being due to uncertainties in the treatment of convection. Our results revise
        earlier published much larger values of M_BH derived from the parameters of
        Wray 977. Then, on the basis of a grid of 37 evolutionary models for massive
        close binaries with various initial masses, mass ratios and periods, we derive
        primary initial-final mass, initial mass-final helium core mass, and initial
        mass-final CO-core mass relations for the various mass transfer cases of close

        Case A/B or the Case C binary channel. Using our grid of binary models, we
        obtain a consistent scenario for the formation of black holes in binary systems.
        We emphasize that in binaries the critical initial mass limits for neutron
        star/black hole formation and for white dwarf/neutron star formation are very
        different from the corresponding values in single stars. While the first may
        well be above 100 M_sun in Case A/B binaries, the latter is found to be in

        Short-lived massive stars are generally considered as the main stellar sources.
        We examine the potential role of less massive stars that lose their envelope
        through interaction with a binary companion. Here, we focus on the role of
        metallicity (Z). For this purpose we used the evolutionary code MESA and created
        tailored atmosphere models with the radiative transfer code CMFGEN. We show
        that typical progenitors, with initial masses of 12 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, produce
        hot and compact stars ( 4 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, 60-80 kK, 1 R<SUB>\u2299</SUB>).
        These stripped stars copiously produce ionizing photons, emitting 60-85% and
        30-60% of their energy as HI and HeI ionizing radiation, for Z = 0.0001-0.02,
        respectively. Their output is comparable to what massive stars emit during
        their Wolf-Rayet phase, if we account for their longer lifetimes and the favorable
        slope of the initial mass function. Their relative importance for reionization
        may be further favored since they emit their photons with a time delay ( 20
        Myr after birth in our fiducial model). This allows time for the dispersal
        of the birth clouds, allowing the ionizing photons to escape into the intergalactic
        medium. At low Z, we find that Roche stripping fails to fully remove the H-rich
        envelope, because of the reduced opacity in the subsurface layers. This is
        in sharp contrast with the assumption of complete stripping that is made in
        rapid population synthesis simulations, which are widely used to simulate
        the binary progenitors of supernovae and gravitational waves. Finally, we

        that show little or no hydrogen comprise roughly one-third of the observed

        are not yet fully understood. Very massive single stars stripped by their
        own winds (\u227325\u221230 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> at solar metallicity) are considered
        viable progenitors of these events. However, recent 1D core-collapse simulations
        show that some massive stars may collapse directly into black holes after
        a failed explosion, with a weak or no visible transient. In this Letter, we
        estimate the effect of direct collapse into a black hole on the rates of stripped-envelope

        envelope do (IIb progenitor candidates), unless we use a prescription that

        loss processes are a key uncertainty in the evolution of massive stars. They
        determine the amount of mass and angular momentum retained by the star, thus
        influencing its evolution and presupernova structure. Because of the high
        complexity of the physical processes driving mass loss, stellar evolution
        calculations must employ parametric algorithms, and usually only include wind
        mass loss. We carried out an extensive parameter study of wind mass loss and
        its effects on massive star evolution using the open-source stellar evolution
        code MESA. We provide a systematic comparison of wind mass loss algorithms
        for solar-metallicity, nonrotating, single stars in the initial mass range
        of 15 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> to 35 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. We consider combinations
        drawn from two hot phase (I.e., roughly the main sequence) algorithms, three
        cool phase (I.e., post-main-sequence) algorithms, and two Wolf-Rayet mass
        loss algorithms. We discuss separately the effects of mass loss in each of
        these phases. In addition, we consider linear wind efficiency scale factors
        of 1, 0.33, and 0.1 to account for suggested reductions in mass loss rates
        due to wind inhomogeneities. We find that the initial to final mass mapping
        for each zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass has a 50% uncertainty if all algorithm
        combinations and wind efficiencies are considered. The ad-hoc efficiency scale
        factor dominates this uncertainty. While the final total mass and internal
        structure of our models vary tremendously with mass loss treatment, final
        luminosity and effective temperature are much less sensitive for stars with
        ZAMS mass \u2272 30 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. This indicates that uncertainty in
        wind mass loss does not negatively affect estimates of the ZAMS mass of most
        single-star supernova progenitors from pre-explosion observations. Our results
        furthermore show that the internal structure of presupernova stars is sensitive
        to variations in both main sequence and post main-sequence mass loss. The
        compactness parameter \u03BE \u221D \u2133 /R(\u2133) has been identified
        as a proxy for the \\\"explodability\\\" of a given presupernova model. We
        find that \u03BE varies by as much as 30% for models of the same ZAMS mass
        evolved with different wind efficiencies and mass loss algorithm combinations.
        This suggests that the details of the mass loss treatment might bias the outcome
        of detailed core-collapse supernova calculations and the predictions for neutron
        star and black hole formation. <P />Data output is available at the CDS via

        supernovae (CCSN) and which implode into BHs-profoundly affects the initial-mass-function

        the work of Sukhbold et al., we compute IMF-averaged yields at solar metallicity
        for a wide range of assumptions, including neutrino-driven engine models with
        extensive BH formation, models with a simple mass threshold for BH formation,
        and a model in which all stars from 8 to 120 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> explode. For
        plausible choices, the overall yields of \u03B1-elements span a factor of
        3, but changes in relative yields are more subtle, typically 0.05-0.2 dex.
        To constrain the overall level of BH formation, ratios of C and N to O or
        Mg are promising diagnostics. To distinguish complex, theoretically motivated
        landscapes from simple mass thresholds, abundance ratios involving Mn or Ni
        are promising because of their sensitivity to the core structure of the CCSN

        early B-type stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and found several groups
        of stars that have chemical compositions that conflict with the theory of
        rotational mixing. Here we extend this study to Galactic and Small Magellanic
        Cloud (SMC) metallicities. <BR />Methods: We provide chemical compositions
        for ~50 Galactic and ~100 SMC early B-type stars and compare these to the
        LMC results. These samples cover a range of projected rotational velocities
        up to ~300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and hence are well suited to testing rotational
        mixing models. The surface nitrogen abundances are utilised as a probe of
        the mixing process since nitrogen is synthesized in the core of the stars
        and mixed to the surface. <BR />Results: In the SMC, we find a population
        of slowly rotating nitrogen-rich stars amongst the early B type core-hydrogen
        burning stars, which is comparable to that found previously in the LMC. The
        identification of non-enriched rapid rotators in the SMC is not possible due
        to the relatively high upper limits on the nitrogen abundance for the fast
        rotators. In the Galactic sample we find no significant enrichment amongst
        the core hydrogen-burning stars, which appears to be in contrast with the
        expectation from both rotating single-star and close binary evolution models.
        However, only a small number of the rapidly rotating stars have evolved enough
        to produce a significant nitrogen enrichment, and these may be analogous to
        the non-enriched rapid rotators previously found in the LMC sample. Finally,
        in each metallicity regime, a population of highly enriched supergiants is
        observed, which cannot be the immediate descendants of core-hydrogen burning
        stars. Their abundances are, however, compatible with them having gone through
        a previous red supergiant phase. Together, these observations paint a complex
        picture of the nitrogen enrichment in massive main sequence and supergiant
        stellar atmospheres, where age and binarity cause crucial effects. Whether
        rotational mixing is required to understand our results remains an open question
        at this time, but could be answered by identifying the true binary fraction
        in those groups of stars that do not agree with single-star evolutionary models.

        similar published data for disk stars, our results confirm the metallicity
        dependence of the C/O ratio known from previous stellar and interstellar studies:
        C/O drops by a factor of \u223C3-4 as O/H decreases from solar to \u223C1/10
        solar. Analysed within the context of standard models for the chemical evolution
        of the solar vicinity, this drop results from the metallicity dependence of
        the C yields from massive stars with mass loss, augmented by the delayed release
        of C from stars of low and intermediate mass. The former is, however, always
        the dominant factor. Our survey has also uncovered tentative evidence to suggest
        that, as the oxygen abundance decreases below [O/H] = -1, [C/O] may not remain
        constant at [C/O] = -0.5, as previously thought, but increase again, possibly
        approaching near-solar values at the lowest metallicities ([O/H] \u2272 -3).

        our maps recover \u223C80%-100% of the continuum emission, indicating that
        \u223C60% of the emission is resolved out on \u223C200 pc scales. We find
        that the [C II] emission in high-redshift galaxies is more spatially extended
        than the rest-frame 160 \u03BCm dust continuum by a factor of 1.6 \xB1 0.4.

        a function of the star formation rate surface density ({{{\u03A3 }}}<SUB>SFR</SUB>}),
        we revisit the [C II] deficit and suggest that the decline in the {L}<SUB>[{{C</SUB>}{{II}}]}/{L}<SUB>FIR</SUB>}
        ratio as a function of {{{\u03A3 }}}<SUB>SFR</SUB>} is consistent with local

        physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics.
        Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open
        source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications
        in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution
        module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations
        of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass
        to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves
        the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses
        adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports
        shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide
        equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data,
        and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate
        Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate
        independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive
        verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the
        wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary
        tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very
        old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M <SUB>sun</SUB> star from
        the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed
        profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning
        phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase;
        the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the
        complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of
        core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and
        the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star. MESA can be downloaded
        from the project Web site (<A href=\\\"http://mesa.sourceforge.net/\\\">http://mesa.sourceforge.net/</A>).\",\n

        grid is employed for nonsolar metallicities). Altogether 78 different model
        supernova explosions are calculated. In each case nucleosynthesis has already
        been determined for 200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the presupernova
        star, including the effects of time dependent convection. Here each star is
        exploded using a piston to give a specified final kinetic energy at infinity
        (typically 1.2 \xD7 10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs), and the explosive modifications
        to the nucleosynthesis, including the effects of neutrino irradiation, determined.

        reaction rate corresponding to 8(300 keV) = 170 keV barns is used in all calculations.
        The synthesis of each isotope is discussed along with its sensitivity to model
        parameters. In each case, the final mass of the collapsed remnant is also
        determined and often found not to correspond to the location of the piston
        (typically the edge of the iron core), but to a \\\"mass cut\\\" farther out.
        This mass cut is sensitive not only to the explosion energy, but also to the
        presupernova structure, stellar mass, and the metallicity. Unless the explosion
        mechanism, for unknown reasons, provides a much larger characteristic energy
        in more massive stars, it appears likely that stars larger than about 30 M<SUB>sun</SUB>
        will experience considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the initial
        launch of a successful shock. While such explosions will produce a viable,
        bright Type II supernova light curve, lacking perhaps the radioactive tail,
        they will have dramatically reduced yields of heavy elements and may leave
        black hole remnants of up to 10 and more solar masses. The production of black
        holes may be particularly favored for stars of low metallicity, both because

        model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to
        masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology
        enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling
        of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates
        a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented
        when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the
        way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing.
        We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> stars through the end
        of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white
        dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical

        MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating

        the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully

        from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation
        instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips
        for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology
        data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and

        /> Aims: Many topical astrophysical research areas, such as the properties
        of planet host stars, the nature of the progenitors of different types of
        supernovae and gamma ray bursts, and the evolution of galaxies, require complete
        and homogeneous sets of stellar models at different metallicities in order
        to be studied during the whole of cosmic history. We present here a first
        set of models for solar metallicity, where the effects of rotation are accounted
        for in a homogeneous way. <BR /> Methods: We computed a grid of 48 different
        stellar evolutionary tracks, both rotating and non-rotating, at Z = 0.014,
        spanning a wide mass range from 0.8 to 120 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. For each of
        the stellar masses considered, electronic tables provide data for 400 stages
        along the evolutionary track and at each stage, a set of 43 physical data
        are given. These grids thus provide an extensive and detailed data basis for
        comparisons with the observations. The rotating models start on the zero-age
        main sequence (ZAMS) with a rotation rate \u03C5<SUB>ini</SUB>/\u03C5<SUB>crit</SUB>
        = 0.4. The evolution is computed until the end of the central carbon-burning
        phase, the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, or the core helium-flash
        for, respectively, the massive, intermediate, and both low and very low mass
        stars. The initial abundances are those deduced by Asplund and collaborators,
        which best fit the observed abundances of massive stars in the solar neighbourhood.
        We update both the opacities and nuclear reaction rates, and introduce new
        prescriptions for the mass-loss rates as stars approach the Eddington and/or
        the critical velocity. We account for both atomic diffusion and magnetic braking
        in our low-mass star models. <BR /> Results: The present rotating models provide
        a good description of the average evolution of non-interacting stars. In particular,
        they reproduce the observed main-sequence width, the positions of the red
        giant and supergiant stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, the observed
        surface compositions and rotational velocities. Very interestingly, the enhancement
        of the mass loss during the red-supergiant stage, when the luminosity becomes
        supra-Eddington in some outer layers, help models above 15-20 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>
        to lose a significant part of their hydrogen envelope and evolve back into
        the blue part of the HR diagram. This result has interesting consequences
        for the blue to red supergiant ratio, the minimum mass for stars to become
        Wolf-Rayet stars, and the maximum initial mass of stars that explode as type
        II-P supernovae. <P />Tracks and isochrones are available at the CDS via anonymous

        recipe with an additional parameter Z. We have found that the exponent of

        between 1/30 &lt;= Z/Z<SUB>sun</SUB> &lt;= 3. The mass-loss rate scales as

        mass loss vs. metallicity dependence is constant over a large range in Z,
        one should be aware of the presence of bi-stability jumps at specific temperatures.
        Here the character of the line driving changes drastically due to recombinations
        of dominant metal species resulting in jumps in the mass loss. We have investigated
        the physical origins of these jumps and have derived formulae that combine
        mass loss recipes for both sides of such jumps. As observations of different
        galaxies show that the ratio Fe/O varies with metallicity, we make a distinction
        between the metal abundance Z derived on the basis of iron or oxygen lines.
        Our mass-loss predictions are successful in explaining the observed mass-loss
        rates for Galactic and Small Magellanic Cloud O-type stars, as well as in
        predicting the observed Galactic bi-stability jump. Hence, we believe that

        medium (ISM) in distant galaxies via molecular and atomic fine structure line
        (FSL) emission have gone from a curious look into a few extreme, rare objects
        to a mainstream tool for studying galaxy formation out to the highest redshifts.
        Molecular gas has been observed in close to 200 galaxies at z &gt; 1, including
        numerous AGN host-galaxies out to z \u223C 7, highly star-forming submillimeter
        galaxies, and increasing samples of main-sequence color-selected star-forming
        galaxies at z \u223C 1.5 to 2.5. Studies have moved well beyond simple detections
        to dynamical imaging at kiloparsec-scale resolution and multiline, multispecies
        studies that determine the physical conditions in the ISM in early galaxies.
        Observations of the cool gas are the required complement to studies of the
        stellar density and star-formation history of the Universe as they reveal
        the phase of the ISM that immediately precedes star formation in galaxies.
        Current observations suggest that the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic
        star-formation rate density from z \u223C 0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar
        increase in the gas-to-stellar mass ratio in star-forming disk galaxies. Progress
        has been made in determining the CO luminosity to H<SUB>2</SUB> mass conversion
        factor at high z, and the dichotomy between high versus low values for main-sequence
        versus starburst galaxies, respectively, appears to persist with increasing
        redshift, with a likely dependence on metallicity and other local physical
        conditions. There may also be two sequences in the relationship between star-formation
        rate and gas mass: one for starbursts, in which the gas consumption timescale
        is short (a few 10<SUP>7</SUP> years), and one for main sequence galaxies,
        with an order of magnitude longer gas consumption timescale. Studies of atomic
        FSL emission are rapidly progressing, with some tens of galaxies detected
        in the exceptionally bright [Cii] 158-\u03BCm line to date. The [Cii] line
        is proving to be a unique tracer of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe
        and, together with other atomic FSLs, has the potential to be the most direct
        means of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the first galaxies during cosmic
        reionization.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Carilli, C. L.\",\n          \"Walter,

        of the interstellar medium in disk galaxies is in the form of neutral atomic
        hydrogen, H I. This gas can be in thermal equilibrium at relatively low temperatures,
        T&lt;~300 K (the cold neutral medium [CNM]), or at temperatures somewhat less
        than 10<SUP>4</SUP> K (the warm neutral medium [WNM]). These two phases can
        coexist over a narrow range of pressures, P<SUB>min</SUB>&lt;=P&lt;=P<SUB>max</SUB>.
        We determine P<SUB>min</SUB> and P<SUB>max</SUB> in the plane of the Galaxy
        as a function of Galactocentric radius R using recent determinations of the
        gas heating rate and the gas-phase abundances of interstellar gas. We provide
        an analytic approximation for P<SUB>min</SUB> as a function of metallicity,
        far-ultraviolet radiation field, and the ionization rate of atomic hydrogen.
        Our analytic results show that the existence of P<SUB>min</SUB>, or the possibility
        of a two-phase equilibrium, generally requires that H<SUP>+</SUP> exceed C<SUP>+</SUP>
        in abundance at P<SUB>min</SUB>. The abundance of H<SUP>+</SUP> is set by
        EUV/soft X-ray photoionization and by recombination with negatively charged
        polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In order to assess whether thermal or pressure
        equilibrium is a realistic assumption, we define a parameter \u03A5\u2261t<SUB>cool</SUB>/t<SUB>shock</SUB>,
        where t<SUB>cool</SUB> is the gas cooling time and t<SUB>shock</SUB> is the
        characteristic shock time or ``time between shocks in a turbulent medium.''
        For \u03A5&lt;1 gas has time to reach thermal balance between supernova-induced
        shocks. We find that this condition is satisfied in the Galactic disk, and
        thus the two-phase description of the interstellar H I is approximately valid
        even in the presence of interstellar turbulence. Observationally, the mean
        density HI&gt; is often better determined than the local density, and we cast
        our results in terms of HI&gt; as well. Over most of the disk of the Galaxy,
        the H I must be in two phases: the weight of the H I in the gravitational
        potential of the Galaxy is large enough to generate thermal pressures exceeding
        P<SUB>min</SUB>, so that turbulent pressure fluctuations can produce cold
        gas that is thermally stable; and the mean density of the H I is too low for
        the gas to be all CNM. Our models predict the presence of CNM gas to R~=16-18
        kpc, somewhat farther than previous estimates. An estimate for the typical
        thermal pressure in the Galactic plane for 3kpc&lt;~R&lt;~18 kpc is P<SUB>th</SUB>/k~=1.4\xD710<SUP>4</SUP>exp(-R/5.5kpc)
        K cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. At the solar circle, this gives P<SUB>th</SUB>/k~=3000

        I<SUB>tot</SUB> ratio observed by Jenkins &amp; Tripp and the CNM temperature
        found by Heiles &amp; Troland. We also examine the potential impact of turbulent
        heating on our results and provide parameterized expressions for the heating
        rate as a function of Galactic radius. Although the uncertainties are large,
        our models predict that including turbulent heating does not significantly

        present a quantitative model for the infrared emission from dust in the diffuse
        interstellar medium. The model consists of a mixture of amorphous silicate
        grains and carbonaceous grains, each with a wide size distribution ranging
        from molecules containing tens of atoms to large grains &gt;~1 \u03BCm in
        diameter. We assume that the carbonaceous grains have properties like polycyclic
        aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at very small sizes and graphitic properties
        for radii a&gt;~50 \xC5. On the basis of recent laboratory studies and guided
        by astronomical observations, we propose ``astronomical'' absorption cross
        sections for use in modeling neutral and ionized PAHs from the far-ultraviolet
        to the far-infrared. We also propose modifications to the far-infrared emissivity
        of ``astronomical silicate.'' We calculate energy distribution functions for
        small grains undergoing ``temperature spikes'' caused by stochastic absorption
        of starlight photons using realistic heat capacities and optical properties.
        Using a grain-size distribution consistent with the observed interstellar
        extinction, we are able to reproduce the near-IR to submillimeter emission
        spectrum of the diffuse interstellar medium, including the PAH emission features
        at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 \u03BCm. The model is compared with the observed
        emission at high Galactic latitudes as well as in the Galactic plane, as measured
        by the COBE/DIRBE, COBE/FIRAS, IRTS/MIRS, and IRTS/NIRS instruments. The model
        has 60\xD710<SUP>-6</SUP> of C (relative to H) locked up in PAHs, with 45\xD710<SUP>-6</SUP>
        of C in a component peaking at ~6 \xC5 (N<SUB>C</SUB>~100 carbon atoms) to
        account for the PAH emission features and with 15\xD710<SUP>-6</SUP> of C

        total infrared emission is in excellent agreement with COBE/DIRBE observations

        mass-loss rates of 64 Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are used to study the
        dependence of mass-loss rates, momentum transfer efficiencies and terminal
        velocities on the basic stellar parameters and chemical composition. The luminosities
        of the WR stars have been determined either directly from the masses, using
        the dependence of L on mass predicted by stellar evolution theory, or they
        were determined from the absolute visual magnitudes and the bolometric corrections.
        For this purpose we improved the relation between the bolometric correction
        and the spectral subclass. (1) The momentum transfer efficiencies \u03B7 (i.e.
        the ratio between the wind momentum loss and radiative momentum loss) of WR
        stars are found to lie in the range of 1.4 to 17.6, with the mean value of
        6.2 for the 64 program stars. Such values can probably be explained by radiative
        driving due to multiple scattering of photons in a WR wind with an ionization
        stratification. However, there may be a problem in explaining the driving
        at low velocities. (2) We derived the linear regression relations for the
        dependence of the terminal velocity, the momentum transfer efficiency and
        the mass-loss rates on luminosity and chemical composition. We found a tight
        relation between the terminal velocity of the wind and the parameters of the
        hydrostatic core. This relation enables the determination of the mass of the
        WR stars from their observed terminal velocities and chemical composition
        with an accuracy of about 0.1 dex for WN and WC stars. Using evolutionary
        models of WR stars, the luminosity can then be determined with an accuracy
        of 0.25 dex or better. (3) We found that the mass-loss rates (&amp;mathaccent
        \\\"705Frelax dot;) of WR stars depend strongly on luminosity and also quite
        strongly on chemical composition. For the combined sample of WN and WC stars

        of \u03C3 = 0.19 dex (4) The new mass-loss rates are significantly smaller
        than adopted in evolutionary calculations, by about 0.2 to 0.6 dex, depending
        on the composition and on the evolutionary calculations. For H-rich WN stars
        the new mass-loss rates are 0.3 dex smaller than adopted in the evolutionary
        calculations of Meynet et al. (1994). (5) The lower mass-loss rates, derived
        in this paper compared to previously adopted values, facilitate the formation
        of black holes as end points of the evolution of massive stars. However they

        in the range of 9 to 120 M<SUB>sun</SUB> at solar metallicity. The following
        effects of rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations
        for non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with
        rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal turbulence,
        shear instability and coupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion
        of angular momentum treated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion
        of the chemical elements. Globally we find that for massive stars the effects
        of rotation have an importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional
        circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in 1-2%
        of the MS lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then slowly evolves
        during the MS phase. The circulation shows two main cells. In the deep interior,
        circulation rises along the polar axis and goes down at the equator, while
        due to the Gratton-\xD6pik term it is the inverse in outer layers. This external
        inverse circulation grows in depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that
        a stationary approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation
        would be inappropriate. After the MS phase, the effects of core contraction
        and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum. The
        surface velocities decrease very much during the MS evolution of the most
        massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a lot of angular
        momentum. This produces some convergence of the velocities, but not necessarily
        towards the break-up velocities. However, stars with masses below ~ 12 M<SUB>sun</SUB>
        with initially high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near
        the end of the MS phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some
        other interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out.
        For an average rotation, the tracks in the HR diagram are modified like a
        moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may increase
        the MS lifetime up to about 30%; for the helium-burning phase the effects
        are smaller and amount to at most 10%. From plots of the isochrones, we find
        that rotation may increase the age estimate by about 25% in general. However,
        for stars with M &gt;~ 40 M<SUB>sun</SUB> and fast rotation, a bluewards ``homogeneous-like''
        track, with important He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting
        the age estimates for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large
        scatter in the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g_eff and log T_eff,
        differences of masses by 30% may easily occur, thus explaining what still
        remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings significant
        surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher masses and rotation.
        While it is not difficult to explain very fast rotators with He- and N-excesses,
        the present models also well account for the many OB stars exhibiting surface
        enrichments and moderate or low rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. \\\\cite{He92},
        \\\\cite{He20}). These stars likely result from initially fast rotators, which
        experienced mixing and lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass
        loss. The comparison of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports
        the conclusion by Venn (\\\\cite{ve95a}, \\\\cite{Ve99}), that these enrichments
        mostly result from mixing during the MS phase, which is also in agreement

        uncertainty of the mass cut and the delay time between core collapse and the
        explosion via neutrino heating put limits on the possible accuracy. The predictions
        are compared with abundances from specific supernova observations (e.g., SN
        1987A, 1993J) or supernova remnants (e.g., G292.O +1.8, N132D). The amount
        of detected <SUP>16</SUP>O and <SUP>12</SUP>C or products from carbon and
        explosive oxygen burning can constrain our knowledge of the effective <SUP>12</SUP>C(\u03B1,

        changing during the decay) can give constraints on Y<SUB>e</SUB> in the innermost

        the necessary delay time between collapse and explosion, in order to permit
        the required mass accretion \u0394M<SUB>acc</SUB>. Provided that the stellar
        precollapse models are reliable, this allows additional insight into the exact
        working of the supernova explosion mechanism. While this has been only possible
        for one supernova until present (SN 1987A, a 20 M<SUB>sun</SUB> star), we
        can also compare the ejected composition from other progenitor masses to abundances
        in low-metallicity stars, which reflect the average Type II supernova composition,

        systems and will interact with a companion during their lifetimes, which helps
        to explain the observed diversity of core-collapse supernovae. Donor stars
        in binary systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass
        transfer. As a result, not only are the surface properties affected, but so
        is the core structure. However, most calculations of the core-collapse properties
        of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study
        of the difference between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and
        stars of the same initial mass (11-21 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) that have been stripped
        due to stable post-main-sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present
        the pre-supernova core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive
        representation of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies,
        at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain
        an extended gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer remains until
        core collapse and is more extended in mass for higher initial stellar masses.
        It originates from the receding of the convective helium core during core
        helium burning in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star
        models. We find that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences
        in the final density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped
        star models have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment
        of core collapse compared to single-star models, which likely results in systematically
        different supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning
        and oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications

        recently calculated models for massive stellar evolution and supernovae coupled
        to a model for Galactic chemical evolution, neutron star and black hole birth
        functions (number of neutron stars and black holes as a function of their
        mass) are determined for the Milky Way galaxy. For those stars that explode
        as Type II supernovae, the models give birth functions that are bimodal with
        peaks at 1.27 and 1.76 M<SUB>sun</SUB> and average masses within those peaks
        of 1.28 and 1.73 M<SUB>0</SUB>. For these stars that explode as Type Ib there
        is a narrower spread of remnant masses, the average being 1.32 M<SUB>sun</SUB>,
        and less evidence for bimodality. These values will be increased, especially
        in the more massive Type II supernovae, if significant accretion continues
        during the initial launching of the shock, and the number of heavier neutron
        stars could be depleted by black hole formation. The principal reason for
        the dichotomy in remnant masses for Type II is the difference in the presupernova
        structure of stars above and below 19 M<SUB>sun</SUB>, the mass separating
        stars that burn carbon convectively from those that produce less carbon and
        burn radiatively. The Type Ib's and the lower mass group of the Type II's
        compare favorably with measured neutron star masses, and in particular to
        the Thorsett et al. (1993) determination of the average neutron star mass
        in 17 systems 1.35\xB10.27 M<SUB>sun</SUB>. Variations in the exponent of
        a Salpeter initial mass function are shown not to affect the locations of
        the two peaks in the distribution function, but do affect their relative amplitudes.
        Sources of uncertainty, in particular placement of the mass cut and sensitivity
        to the explosion energy, are discussed, and estimates of the total number
        of neutron stars and black holes in the Galaxy are given. Accretion-induced
        collapse should give a unique gravitational mass of 1.27 M<SUB>sun</SUB>,
        although this could increase if accretion onto the newly formed star continues.
        A similar mass will typify stars in the 8-11 M<SUB>sun</SUB> range (e.g.,
        the Crab pulsar). The lightest neutron star produced is 1.15 M<SUB>sun</SUB>
        for the Type II models and 1.22 M<SUB>sun</SUB> for the Type Ib models. Altogether

        era of large transient surveys, gravitational-wave observatories, and multi-messenger
        astronomy has opened up new possibilities for our understanding of the evolution
        and final fate of massive stars. Most massive stars are born in binary or
        higher-order multiple systems and exchange mass with a companion star during
        their lives. In particular, the progenitors of a large fraction of compact-object
        mergers, and Galactic neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) have been
        stripped of their envelopes by a binary companion. Here, we study the evolution
        of single and stripped binary stars up to core collapse with the stellar evolution
        code MESA and their final fates with a parametric supernova (SN) model. We
        find that stripped binary stars can have systematically different pre-SN structures
        compared to genuine single stars and thus also different SN outcomes. These
        differences are already established by the end of core helium burning and
        are preserved up to core collapse. Consequently, we find that Case A and B
        stripped stars and single and Case C stripped stars develop qualitatively
        similar pre-SN core structures. We find a non-monotonic pattern of NS and
        BH formation as a function of CO core mass that is different in single and
        stripped binary stars. In terms of initial mass, single stars of \u227335
        M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> all form BHs, while this transition is only at about 70
        M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> in stripped stars. On average, stripped stars give rise
        to lower NS and BH masses, higher explosion energies, higher kick velocities,
        and higher nickel yields. Within a simplified population-synthesis model,
        we show that our results lead to a significant reduction in the rates of BH-NS
        and BH-BH mergers with respect to typical assumptions made on NS and BH formation.
        Therefore, our models predict lower detection rates of such merger events
        with for example the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
        (LIGO) than is often considered. Further, we show how certain features in
        the NS-BH mass distribution of single and stripped stars relate to the chirp-mass
        distribution of compact object mergers. Further implications of our findings
        are discussed with respect to the missing red-supergiant problem, a possible
        mass gap between NSs and BHs, X-ray binaries, and observationally inferred
        nickel masses from Type Ib/c and IIP SNe.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Schneider,

        mass stars and yields from massive stars which include, for the first time,
        the combined effect of metallicity, mass loss, and rotation for a large grid
        of stellar masses and for all stages of stellar evolution. The yields of massive

        at low metallicity and to avoid overproduction of s-elements at intermediate

        of rotating massive stars at sub-solar metallicities. We find that those stars
        produce primary F and dominate its solar abundance and we confirm their role

        have been suggested: asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and massive stars
        rotating near the break-up limit (spin stars). We propose massive binaries
        as an alternative source of processed material. We compute the evolution of
        a 20 {M}<SUB>\u2299</SUB> star in a close binary considering the effects of
        non conservative mass and angular momentum transfer and of rotation and tidal

        Mg is not significantly depleted in the ejecta of this model. In contrast
        to the fast, radiatively driven winds of massive stars, this material is typically

        components, and of single helium stars with initial masses of 2.8-20 M <SUB>sun</SUB>.
        We find that, despite the impact of tidal interaction on the rotation of primary
        stars, the amount of angular momentum retained in the core at the presupernova
        stage in different binary model sequences converges to a value similar to
        those found in previous single star models. This amount is large enough to
        produce millisecond pulsars, but too small to produce magnetars or long gamma-ray
        bursts. We employ the most up-to-date estimate for the Wolf-Rayet mass-loss
        rate, and its implications for SN Ib/c progenitors are discussed in detail.
        In terms of stellar structure, SN Ib/c progenitors in binary systems at solar

        should be bimodal. Furthermore, we find that a thin hydrogen layer (0.001

        elements during the red supergiant phase, which in turn favours a large loss
        of mass by stellar winds, especially as rotation also increases the duration
        of this phase. On the whole, the low Z stars may lose about half of their
        mass. Massive stars initially rotating at half of their critical velocity
        are likely to avoid the pair-instability supernova. The chemical composition
        of the rotationally enhanced winds of very low Z stars show large CNO enhancements
        by factors of 10<SUP>3</SUP> to 10^7, together with large excesses of <SUP>13</SUP>C
        and <SUP>17</SUP>O and moderate amounts of Na and Al. The excesses of primary
        N are particularly striking. When these ejecta from the rotationally enhanced
        winds are diluted with the supernova ejecta from the corresponding CO cores,
        we find [C/Fe], [N/Fe], [O/Fe] abundance ratios that are very similar to those

        of carbon, while intermediate-mass stars between 4 and 8 M<SUB>solar</SUB>,
        with a characteristic lag time of roughly 250 Myr following their formation,
        dominate nitrogen production. Carbon production is positively sensitive to
        metallicity through mass-loss processes in massive stars and has a pseudo-secondary

        low star formation rates that flatten the age-metallicity relation and allow
        N/O to rise to observed levels at low metallicities. The observed scatter

        binaries that merge as compact objects are the progenitors of gravitational-wave
        sources. Most of these binaries experience one or more phases of mass transfer,
        during which one of the stars loses all or part of its outer envelope and
        becomes a stripped-envelope star. The evolution of the size of these stripped
        stars is crucial in determining whether they experience further interactions
        and understanding their ultimate fate. We present new calculations of stripped-envelope
        stars based on binary evolution models computed with MESA. We use these to
        investigate their radius evolution as a function of mass and metallicity.
        We further discuss their pre-supernova observable characteristics and potential
        consequences of their evolution on the properties of supernovae from stripped
        stars. At high metallicity, we find that practically all of the hydrogen-rich
        envelope is removed, which is in agreement with earlier findings. Only progenitors
        with initial masses below 10 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> expand to large radii (up

        At low metallicity, a substantial amount of hydrogen remains and the progenitors
        can, in principle, expand to giant sizes (&gt; 400 R<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) for
        all masses we consider. This implies that they can fill their Roche lobe anew.
        We show that the prescriptions commonly used in population synthesis models

        than at high metallicities. Here we investigate the impact of rotation and
        metallicity on stellar evolution. Using similar physics as in our previous
        large grids of models at Z = 0.002 and Z = 0.014, we compute stellar evolution
        models with the Geneva code for rotating and nonrotating stars with initial
        masses (M<SUB>ini</SUB>) between 1.7 and 120 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> and Z = 0.0004
        (1/35 solar). This is comparable to the metallicities of the most metal poor
        galaxies observed so far, such as I Zw 18. Concerning massive stars, both
        rotating and nonrotating models spend most of their core-helium burning phase
        with an effective temperature higher than 8000 K. Stars become red supergiants
        only at the end of their lifetimes, and few red supergiants are expected.
        Our models predict very few to no classical Wolf-Rayet stars as a results
        of weak stellar winds at low metallicity. The most massive stars end their
        lifetimes as luminous blue supergiants or luminous blue variables, a feature
        that is not predicted by models with higher initial metallicities. Interestingly,
        due to the behavior of the intermediate convective zone, the mass domain of
        stars producing pair-instability supernovae is smaller at Z = 0.0004 than
        at Z = 0.002. We find that during the main sequence (MS) phase, the ratio
        between nitrogen and carbon abundances (N/C) remains unchanged for nonrotating
        models. However, N/C increases by factors of 10-20 in rotating models at the
        end of the MS. Cepheids coming from stars with M<SUB>ini</SUB> &gt; 4 - 6
        M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> are beyond the core helium burning phase and spend little
        time in the instability strip. Since they would evolve towards cooler effective
        temperatures, these Cepheids should show an increase of the pulsation period
        as a function of age. <P />The stellar evolution tracks and tables are only

        15, 20, 25, 40 and 60 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> were computed from the ZAMS until
        the end of the core silicon burning phase. We took into account meridional
        circulation, secular shear instabilities, horizontal turbulence and dynamical
        shear instabilities. We find that dynamical shear instabilities mainly smoothen
        the sharp angular velocity gradients but do not transport angular momentum
        or chemical species over long distances. Most of the differences between the
        pre-supernova structures obtained from rotating and non-rotating stellar models
        have their origin in the effects of rotation during the core hydrogen and
        helium burning phases. The advanced stellar evolutionary stages appear too
        short in time to allow the rotational instabilities considered in this work
        to have a significant impact during the late stages. In particular, the internal

        being due to uncertainties in the treatment of convection. Our results revise

        Wray 977. Then, on the basis of a grid of 37 evolutionary models for massive
        close binaries with various initial masses, mass ratios and periods, we derive
        primary initial-final mass, initial mass-final helium core mass, and initial

        We emphasize that in binaries the critical initial mass limits for neutron

        different from the corresponding values in single stars. While the first may

        Short-lived massive stars are generally considered as the main stellar sources.
        We examine the potential role of less massive stars that lose their envelope
        through interaction with a binary companion. Here, we focus on the role of
        metallicity (Z). For this purpose we used the evolutionary code MESA and created
        tailored atmosphere models with the radiative transfer code CMFGEN. We show
        that typical progenitors, with initial masses of 12 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, produce
        hot and compact stars ( 4 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, 60-80 kK, 1 R<SUB>\u2299</SUB>).
        These stripped stars copiously produce ionizing photons, emitting 60-85% and
        30-60% of their energy as HI and HeI ionizing radiation, for Z = 0.0001-0.02,
        respectively. Their output is comparable to what massive stars emit during
        their Wolf-Rayet phase, if we account for their longer lifetimes and the favorable
        slope of the initial mass function. Their relative importance for reionization
        may be further favored since they emit their photons with a time delay ( 20
        Myr after birth in our fiducial model). This allows time for the dispersal
        of the birth clouds, allowing the ionizing photons to escape into the intergalactic
        medium. At low Z, we find that Roche stripping fails to fully remove the H-rich
        envelope, because of the reduced opacity in the subsurface layers. This is
        in sharp contrast with the assumption of complete stripping that is made in
        rapid population synthesis simulations, which are widely used to simulate
        the binary progenitors of supernovae and gravitational waves. Finally, we

        important in many fields of astrophysics including nucleosynthesis, stellar
        structure, evolution of galaxies, and formation of planetary systems. Still,
        our knowledge of the abundances of these elements in different stellar populations
        is uncertain because of difficulties in observing and analyzing atomic and
        molecular lines of C and O. <BR /> Aims: Abundances of C, O, and Fe are determined
        for F and G main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood with metallicities
        in the range -1.6 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; +0.4 in order to study trends and possible
        systematic differences in the C/Fe, O/Fe, and C/O ratios for thin- and thick-disk
        stars as well as high- and low-alpha halo stars. In addition, we investigate
        if there is any connection between C and O abundances in stellar atmospheres
        and the occurrence of planets. <BR /> Methods: Carbon abundances are determined
        from the \u03BB\u03BB 5052,5380 C i lines and oxygen abundances from the \u03BB7774
        O i triplet and the forbidden [O i] line at 6300 \xC5. MARCS model atmospheres

        /> Results: Systematic differences between high- and low-alpha halo stars
        and between thin- and thick-disk stars are seen in the trends of [C/Fe] and
        [O/Fe]. The two halo populations and thick-disk stars show the same trend
        of [C/O] versus [O/H], whereas the thin-disk stars are shifted to higher [C/O]
        values. Furthermore, we find some evidence of higher C/O and C/Fe ratios in
        stars hosting planets than in stars for which no planets have been detected.
        <BR /> Conclusions: The results suggest that C and O in both high- and low-alpha
        halo stars and in thick-disk stars are made mainly in massive (M&gt; 8 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>)
        stars, whereas thin-disk stars have an additional carbon contribution from
        low-mass AGB and massive stars of high metallicity causing a rising trend
        of the C/O ratio with increasing metallicity. However, at the highest metallicities
        investigated ([Fe/H] \u2243 + 0.4), C/O does not exceed 0.8, which seems to
        exclude formation of carbon planets if proto-planetary disks have the same

        loss processes are a key uncertainty in the evolution of massive stars. They
        determine the amount of mass and angular momentum retained by the star, thus
        influencing its evolution and presupernova structure. Because of the high
        complexity of the physical processes driving mass loss, stellar evolution
        calculations must employ parametric algorithms, and usually only include wind
        mass loss. We carried out an extensive parameter study of wind mass loss and
        its effects on massive star evolution using the open-source stellar evolution
        code MESA. We provide a systematic comparison of wind mass loss algorithms
        for solar-metallicity, nonrotating, single stars in the initial mass range
        of 15 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> to 35 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. We consider combinations
        drawn from two hot phase (I.e., roughly the main sequence) algorithms, three
        cool phase (I.e., post-main-sequence) algorithms, and two Wolf-Rayet mass
        loss algorithms. We discuss separately the effects of mass loss in each of
        these phases. In addition, we consider linear wind efficiency scale factors
        of 1, 0.33, and 0.1 to account for suggested reductions in mass loss rates
        due to wind inhomogeneities. We find that the initial to final mass mapping
        for each zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass has a 50% uncertainty if all algorithm
        combinations and wind efficiencies are considered. The ad-hoc efficiency scale
        factor dominates this uncertainty. While the final total mass and internal
        structure of our models vary tremendously with mass loss treatment, final
        luminosity and effective temperature are much less sensitive for stars with
        ZAMS mass \u2272 30 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. This indicates that uncertainty in
        wind mass loss does not negatively affect estimates of the ZAMS mass of most
        single-star supernova progenitors from pre-explosion observations. Our results
        furthermore show that the internal structure of presupernova stars is sensitive
        to variations in both main sequence and post main-sequence mass loss. The
        compactness parameter \u03BE \u221D \u2133 /R(\u2133) has been identified
        as a proxy for the \\\"explodability\\\" of a given presupernova model. We
        find that \u03BE varies by as much as 30% for models of the same ZAMS mass
        evolved with different wind efficiencies and mass loss algorithm combinations.
        This suggests that the details of the mass loss treatment might bias the outcome
        of detailed core-collapse supernova calculations and the predictions for neutron

        the work of Sukhbold et al., we compute IMF-averaged yields at solar metallicity
        for a wide range of assumptions, including neutrino-driven engine models with
        extensive BH formation, models with a simple mass threshold for BH formation,
        and a model in which all stars from 8 to 120 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> explode. For
        plausible choices, the overall yields of \u03B1-elements span a factor of
        3, but changes in relative yields are more subtle, typically 0.05-0.2 dex.
        To constrain the overall level of BH formation, ratios of C and N to O or
        Mg are promising diagnostics. To distinguish complex, theoretically motivated
        landscapes from simple mass thresholds, abundance ratios involving Mn or Ni

        early B-type stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and found several groups
        of stars that have chemical compositions that conflict with the theory of
        rotational mixing. Here we extend this study to Galactic and Small Magellanic
        Cloud (SMC) metallicities. <BR />Methods: We provide chemical compositions
        for ~50 Galactic and ~100 SMC early B-type stars and compare these to the
        LMC results. These samples cover a range of projected rotational velocities
        up to ~300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and hence are well suited to testing rotational
        mixing models. The surface nitrogen abundances are utilised as a probe of
        the mixing process since nitrogen is synthesized in the core of the stars
        and mixed to the surface. <BR />Results: In the SMC, we find a population
        of slowly rotating nitrogen-rich stars amongst the early B type core-hydrogen
        burning stars, which is comparable to that found previously in the LMC. The
        identification of non-enriched rapid rotators in the SMC is not possible due
        to the relatively high upper limits on the nitrogen abundance for the fast
        rotators. In the Galactic sample we find no significant enrichment amongst
        the core hydrogen-burning stars, which appears to be in contrast with the
        expectation from both rotating single-star and close binary evolution models.
        However, only a small number of the rapidly rotating stars have evolved enough
        to produce a significant nitrogen enrichment, and these may be analogous to
        the non-enriched rapid rotators previously found in the LMC sample. Finally,
        in each metallicity regime, a population of highly enriched supergiants is
        observed, which cannot be the immediate descendants of core-hydrogen burning
        stars. Their abundances are, however, compatible with them having gone through
        a previous red supergiant phase. Together, these observations paint a complex
        picture of the nitrogen enrichment in massive main sequence and supergiant
        stellar atmospheres, where age and binarity cause crucial effects. Whether
        rotational mixing is required to understand our results remains an open question
        at this time, but could be answered by identifying the true binary fraction
        in those groups of stars that do not agree with single-star evolutionary models.

        is presented. Results of numerical computations are described for the evolution
        of a massive binary in the case when the Roche lobe is filled up by the primary
        after the exhaustion of the central hydrogen. As a result of a rapid mass
        transfer to the secondary the primary component of initial mass 16 M_odot
        lost 9.1 M_odot in only 4x10^3 years. Further evolution was not computed,
        but we anticipate that it should follow the case B of Kippenhahn and Weigert
        (1967). Thus, after a somewhat slower exchange of additional 2-3 M_odot the
        primary (now the less massive component should settle down near the main sequence
        for the helium burning stars. We identify this star with the Wolf-Rayet component
        of known massive binaries. The range of initial conditions that will lead
        to this type of evolution is discussed. In particular the initial mass of
        the primary component should be in the range of 5-65 M_odot.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Paczy\u0144ski,

        trends of chemical abundances and abundance ratios observed in stars of different
        ages, kinematics, and metallicities bear the imprints of several physical
        processes which concur, thus shaping the host galaxy properties. By inspecting
        these trends, we obtain precious information on stellar nucleosynthesis, the
        stellar mass spectrum, the timescale of structure formation, the efficiency
        of star formation, as well as any inward or outward flows of gas. In this
        paper, we analyse recent determinations of carbon-to-iron and carbon-to-oxygen
        abundance ratios in different environments (the Milky Way and elliptical galaxies),
        using our latest chemical evolution models that implement up-to-date stellar
        yields and rely on the tight constraints provided by asteroseismic stellar
        ages, whenever available. A scenario where most carbon is produced by rotating
        massive stars, with yields largely dependent on the metallicity of the parent
        proto-star clouds, allowed us to simultaneously fit the high-quality data
        available for the local Galactic components (thick and thin discs) and for
        microlensed dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge, as well as the abundance ratios
        inferred for massive elliptical galaxies. Nevertheless, more efforts are needed

        in 34 F and G dwarf and subgiant stars belonging to the halo population and
        spanning a range of metallicity from [Fe/H] = -0.7 to -3.2 . The survey is
        based on observations of four permitted lines of C I near 9100 \xC5 and the
        O I,\u03BB 7774 triplet, all recorded at high signal-to-noise ratios with
        the UVES echelle spectrograph on the ESO VLT. The line equivalent widths were
        analysed with the 1D, LTE, MARCS model atmosphere code to deduce C and O abundances;
        corrections due to non-LTE and 3D effects are discussed. When combined with
        similar published data for disk stars, our results confirm the metallicity
        dependence of the C/O ratio known from previous stellar and interstellar studies:
        C/O drops by a factor of \u223C3-4 as O/H decreases from solar to \u223C1/10
        solar. Analysed within the context of standard models for the chemical evolution
        of the solar vicinity, this drop results from the metallicity dependence of
        the C yields from massive stars with mass loss, augmented by the delayed release
        of C from stars of low and intermediate mass. The former is, however, always
        the dominant factor. Our survey has also uncovered tentative evidence to suggest
        that, as the oxygen abundance decreases below [O/H] = -1, [C/O] may not remain
        constant at [C/O] = -0.5, as previously thought, but increase again, possibly
        approaching near-solar values at the lowest metallicities ([O/H] \u2272 -3).
        With the current dataset this is no more than a 3\u03C3 effect and it may
        be due to metallicity-dependent non-LTE corrections to the [C/O] ratio which
        have not been taken into account. However, its potential importance as a window
        on the nucleosynthesis by Population III stars is a strong incentive for future
        work, both observational and theoretical, to verify its reality. <P />Based

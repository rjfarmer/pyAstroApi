        cosmic origin of carbon, a fundamental building block of life, is still uncertain.
        Yield predictions for massive stars are almost exclusively based on single-star
        models, even though a large fraction interact with a binary companion. Using
        the MESA stellar evolution code, we predict the amount of carbon ejected in
        the winds and supernovae of single and binary-stripped stars at solar metallicity.
        We find that binary-stripped stars are twice as efficient at producing carbon
        (1.5-2.6 times, depending on choices regarding the slope of the initial mass
        function and black hole formation). We confirm that this is because the convective
        helium core recedes in stars that have lost their hydrogen envelope, as noted
        previously. The shrinking of the core disconnects the outermost carbon-rich
        layers created during the early phase of helium burning from the more central
        burning regions. The same effect prevents carbon destruction, even when the
        supernova shock wave passes. The yields are sensitive to the treatment of
        mixing at convective boundaries, specifically during carbon-shell burning
        (variations up to 40%), and improving upon this should be a central priority
        for more reliable yield predictions. The yields are robust (variations less
        than 0.5%) across our range of explosion assumptions. Black hole formation
        assumptions are also important, implying that the stellar graveyard now explored
        by gravitational-wave detections may yield clues to better understand the
        cosmic carbon production. Our findings also highlight the importance of accounting
        for binary-stripped stars in chemical yield predictions and motivates further
        studies of other products of binary interactions.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Farmer,

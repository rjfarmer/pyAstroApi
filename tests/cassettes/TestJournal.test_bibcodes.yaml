        astrophysics is a new and quickly growing discipline. In this book the authors

        general-purpose simulation environment in astrophysics written in Python.
        AMUSE allows you to combine existing solvers to build new applications that
        can be combined again to study gradually more complex situations. This enables
        the growth of multi-physics and multi-scale application software in a hierarchical
        fashion, testing each intermediate step as the complexity of the software
        continues to increase. All examples in the book are associated with codes

        We obtain a family of self-similar solutions where the temperature of the

        at much less than the Keplerian angular velocity; therefore, the central stars

        Further, the Bernoulli parameter is positive, implying that advection-dominated

        of these flows and, if present, will tend to enhance the above effects. We

        low magnetic field neutron stars which accrete for long times from a surrounding
        keplerian disk can be spun up to millisecond periods. After accretion ceases,
        such stars could become isolated or binary pulsars, depending on whether their
        companions have subsequently disrupted the binary by either their tidal break
        ups or their supernova explosions. Such pulsars constitute a new class, with
        short periods, long apparent ages (P/\u1E56 \u2273 10<SUP>8</SUP> yr) and

        4+7 orders of magnitude less than the expected number of neutron stars and
        black holes in binary systems. It is shown in the paper that the main condition
        for the appearance of X-ray source in a binary system including relativistic
        star is that the size of the normal component must be close to size of its
        critical Roche lobe. In the case of accretion of the stellar wind matter in
        detached binary system the specific angular momentum of the matter captured
        by the relativistic star is small. Therefore the accreting disk is not formed
        around relativistic star. Consequently, a black hole in detached binary system
        can not be strong X-ray source (no matter how strong the stellar wind might
        be). In this case the accretion is spherically-symmetric and black hole is
        the source of hard X-ray and y-ray radiation. Young neutron star in detached
        system is ejecting pulsar, radiating in X-ray spectral band, like the Crab
        pulsar. Its radioemission is absorbed in stellar wind plasma due to free-free
        processes. Deceleration of the pulsar rotation and connected decrease of its
        luminosity makes possible the penetration of the ambient plasma inside light
        cylinder. This may lead to the switching off of the pulsar mechanism. However
        rapidly rotating magnetosphere of the neutron star throws away the falling
        matter, preventing the accretion. The rotation, consequently, continues to
        decelerate. Only after sufficient deceleration of neutron star rotation the
        accretion becomes possible and neutron star will be the X-ray source. However
        the estimates show that the deceleration time up to this stage exceeds the
        evolutionary time of the normal component. Only in the extremely close binaries
        having anomalously strong accreting matter flow it is possible for the magnetized
        neutron star to convert into the X-ray sources. For the same reason old single
        pulsars with strong magnetic field never become the sources of ultra-violet
        and soft X-ray radiation. Key words: black holes and neutron stars accretion

        not (even asymptotically) adhere to their nominal \u03C7<SUP>2</SUP> and F-distributions
        in many statistical tests common in astrophysics, thereby casting many marginal
        line or source detections and nondetections into doubt. Although the above
        authors illustrate the many legitimate uses of these statistics, in some important
        cases it can be impossible to compute the correct false positive rate. For
        example, it has become common practice to use the LRT or the F-test to detect
        a line in a spectral model or a source above background despite the lack of
        certain required regularity conditions. (These applications were not originally
        suggested by Cash or by Bevington.) In these and other settings that involve
        testing a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space, contrary
        to common practice, the nominal \u03C7<SUP>2</SUP> distribution for the LRT
        or the F-distribution for the F-test should not be used. In this paper, we
        characterize an important class of problems in which the LRT and the F-test
        fail and illustrate this nonstandard behavior. We briefly sketch several possible
        acceptable alternatives, focusing on Bayesian posterior predictive probability
        values. We present this method in some detail since it is a simple, robust,
        and intuitive approach. This alternative method is illustrated using the gamma-ray
        burst of 1997 May 8 (GRB 970508) to investigate the presence of an Fe K emission
        line during the initial phase of the observation. There are many legitimate
        uses of the LRT and the F-test in astrophysics, and even when these tests
        are inappropriate, there remain several statistical alternatives (e.g., judicious
        use of error bars and Bayes factors). Nevertheless, there are numerous cases
        of the inappropriate use of the LRT and similar tests in the literature, bringing

        radio pulsars are neutron stars with magnetic fields of ~10<SUP>12</SUP> gauss

        pulsars have much weaker fields (~10<SUP>9</SUP> gauss) and faster, millisecond

        `spins down' as energy is radiated away. Millisecond radio pulsars are often

        systems can accrete matter and angular momentum from the companion star and
        be spun-up to millisecond rotational periods. During the accretion stage,
        the system is called a low-mass X-ray binary, and bright X-ray emission is
        observed. When the rate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary
        stages, these binaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered
        by the neutron star's rotating magnetic field. This evolutionary model is
        supported by the detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting
        neutron stars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered
        millisecond pulsar. It has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may
        temporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.
        Only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. Here
        we report observations of accretion-powered, millisecond X-ray pulsations
        from a neutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. Within
        a few days after a month-long X-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected.

        a significant torque on the star. On the assumption that the distortion of

        X-1 has a spin-up rate much below the conventional estimate for slow rotators.
        It is shown that for such fast rotators, fluctuations in the mass-accretion
        rate can produce fluctuations in the accretion torque about 100 times larger.

        amplitudes (rms) of 2.5%--10% are present in six of the eight bursts analyzed
        to date. The strongest were seen in two successive bursts recorded on 1996
        February 16 when the quiescent count rate was near the highest seen by PCA.
        The pulsations during these bursts show frequency changes of 1.5 Hz during
        the first few seconds but become effectively coherent as the burst decays.
        We interpret the 363 Hz pulsations as rotationally induced modulations of

        for a millisecond spin period in a low-mass X-ray binary. Complex, intensity-dependent,
        millisecond X-ray variability is also present in all the quiescent flux intervals

        to pulsate in the visible band; such a detection took place when the pulsar
        was surrounded by an accretion disk and also showed X-ray pulsations. We report
        on the first high time resolution observational campaign of this transitional
        pulsar in the disk state, using simultaneous observations in the optical (Telescopio
        Nazionale Galileo, Nordic Optical Telescope, Telescopi Joan Or\xF3), X-ray
        (XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, NICER), infrared (Gran Telescopio Canarias), and UV (Swift)
        bands. Optical and X-ray pulsations were detected simultaneously in the X-ray
        high-intensity mode in which the source spends \u223C70% of the time, and
        both disappeared in the low mode, indicating a common underlying physical
        mechanism. In addition, optical and X-ray pulses were emitted within a few
        kilometers and had similar pulse shapes and distributions of the pulsed flux
        density compatible with a power-law relation F <SUB> \u03BD </SUB> \u221D
        \u03BD <SUP>-0.7</SUP> connecting the optical and the 0.3-45 keV X-ray band.
        Optical pulses were also detected during flares with a pulsed flux reduced
        by one-third with respect to the high mode; the lack of a simultaneous detection
        of X-ray pulses is compatible with the lower photon statistics. We show that
        magnetically channeled accretion of plasma onto the surface of the neutron
        star cannot account for the optical pulsed luminosity (\u223C10<SUP>31</SUP>
        erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>). On the other hand, magnetospheric rotation-powered pulsar

        X-ray Transients (SXRTs) have long been suspected to contain old, weakly magnetic
        neutron stars that have been spun up by accretion torques. After reviewing
        their observational properties, we analyse the different regimes that likely
        characterise the neutron stars in these systems across the very large range
        of mass inflow rates, from the peak of the outbursts to the quiescent emission.
        While it is clear that close to the outburst maxima accretion onto the neutron
        star surface takes place, as the mass inflow rate decreases, accretion might
        stop at the magnetospheric boundary because of the centrifugal barrier provided
        by the neutron star. For low enough mass inflow rates (and sufficiently short
        rotation periods), the radio pulsar mechanism might turn on and sweep the
        inflowing matter away. The origin of the quiescent emission, observed in a
        number of SXRTs at a level of ~10<SUP>32</SUP>-10<SUP>33</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>,
        plays a crucial role in constraining the neutron star magnetic field and spin
        period. Accretion onto the neutron star surface is an unlikely mechanism for
        the quiescent emission of SXRTs, as it requires very low magnetic fields and/or
        long spin periods. Thermal radiation from a cooling neutron star surface in
        between the outbursts can be ruled out as the only cause of the quiescent
        emission. We find that accretion onto the neutron star magnetosphere and shock
        emission powered by an enshrouded radio pulsar provide far more plausible
        models. In the latter case the range of allowed neutron star spin periods
        and magnetic fields is consistent with the values recently inferred from the
        properties of kHz quasi-periodic oscillation in low mass X-ray binaries. If
        quiescent SXRTs contain enshrouded radio pulsars, they provide a missing link

        wind can lead to the transition of an isolated pulsar to the accreting state.
        This transition naturally leads to the formation of relativistic jets, whose
        power can greatly exceed the power of the isolated pulsar\u2019s wind. If
        the accretion rate is below a critical value, the pulsar instead expels the
        accretion stream. More generally, our simulations produce for the first time
        the four possible accretion regimes, in order of decreasing mass accretion
        rate: (a) crushed magnetosphere and direct accretion; (b) magnetically channeled
        accretion onto the stellar poles; (c) the propeller state, where material
        enters through the light cylinder but is prevented from accreting by the centrifugal
        barrier; (d) almost perfect exclusion of the accretion flow from the light
        cylinder by the pulsar wind.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Parfrey, Kyle\",\n

        roughly multi-year timescales, between rotation-powered radio millisecond
        pulsar (RMSP) and accretion-powered low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) states. The
        tMSPs have raised several questions related to the nature of accretion flow
        in their LMXB state and the mechanism that causes the state switch. The discovery
        of coherent X-ray pulsations from PSR J1023+0038 (while in the LMXB state)
        provides us with the first opportunity to perform timing observations and
        to compare the neutron star\u2019s spin variation during this state to the
        measured spin-down in the RMSP state. Whereas the X-ray pulsations in the
        LMXB state likely indicate that some material is accreting onto the neutron
        star\u2019s magnetic polar caps, radio continuum observations indicate the
        presence of an outflow. The fraction of the inflowing material being ejected
        is not clear, but it may be much larger than that reaching the neutron star\u2019s
        surface. Timing observations can measure the total torque on the neutron star.
        We have phase-connected nine XMM-Newton observations of PSR J1023+0038 over
        the last 2.5 years of the LMXB state to establish a precise measurement of
        spin evolution. We find that the average spin-down rate as an LMXB is 26.8
        \xB1 0.4% faster than the rate (-2.39 \xD7 10<SUP>-15</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>)
        determined during the RMSP state. This shows that negative angular momentum
        contributions (dipolar magnetic braking, and outflow) exceed positive ones
        (accreted material), and suggests that the pulsar wind continues to operate
        at a largely unmodified level. We discuss implications of this tight observational

        simultaneous X-ray and radio continuum coverage for the first time unambiguously
        show a highly reproducible, anti-correlated variability pattern. The characteristic
        switches from the X-ray high mode into a low mode are always accompanied by

        of plasma by the active rotation-powered pulsar, possibly initiated by a reconfiguration
        of the pulsar magnetosphere, that cause a transition to a less X-ray luminous
        mode. The observed anti-correlation between radio and X-ray luminosity has
        an additional consequence: transitional MSPs can make excursions into a region
        of the radio/X-ray luminosity plane previously thought to be occupied solely
        by black hole X-ray binary sources. This complicates the use of this luminosity

        for both cases assuming that a small 'kick' was imparted by a slightly asymmetric
        supernova explosion, although such an explosion is not absolutely necessary
        in the second case. In the first scenario, the companion of the pulsar is
        thought to be a temporarily undersized lower main-sequence star stripped of
        its envelope by the explosion, and the apsidal motion period of the system
        is predicted to be a few months. It is shown that such a system may become
        a low-mass X-ray binary similar to Sco X-1 upon reexpansion of the companion.
        In the second scenario, the companion is thought to be a collapsed star, and
        the system would have only a small general relativistic apsidal motion. Evolution
        from a system like HZ 29 is found to be impossible.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Flannery,

        and magnetic moment, and the disk's viscosity and diffusivity. We focus on
        the ``propeller'' regime where the inner radius of the disk is larger than
        the corotation radius. Two types of magnetohydrodynamic flows have been found
        as a result of simulations: ``weak'' and ``strong'' propellers. The strong
        propellers are characterized by a powerful disk wind and a collimated magnetically
        dominated outflow or jet from the star. The weak propellers have only weak
        outflows. We investigated the time-averaged characteristics of the interaction

        the disk, and the jet. Rates of exchange of mass and angular momentum between
        the elements of the system are derived as a function of the main parameters.

        emission was variable on timescales from hundreds to thousands of seconds.
        The spectrum showed prominent emission lines with variable profiles at different
        epochs. Simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations revealed a bimodal
        distribution of the X-ray count rates on timescales as short as tens of seconds,
        as well as sporadic flaring activity. The average broad-band (0.3-79 keV)
        spectrum was adequately described by an absorbed power law model with photon
        index of \u0393 = 1.63 \xB1 0.01 (at 1\u03C3 c.l.), and the X-ray luminosity
        was (2.16 \xB1 0.04) \xD7 10<SUP>34</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> for a distance

        of matter onto a magnetic, rotating object can be strongly affected by the
        interaction with its magnetic field. This occurs in a variety of astrophysical
        settings involving young stellar objects, white dwarfs, and neutron stars.
        As matter is endowed with angular momentum, its inflow toward the star is
        often mediated by an accretion disc. The pressure of matter and that originating
        from the stellar magnetic field balance at the magnetospheric radius: at smaller
        distances the motion of matter is dominated by the magnetic field, and funnelling
        towards the magnetic poles ensues. However, if the star, and thus its magnetosphere,
        is fast spinning, most of the inflowing matter will be halted at the magnetospheric
        radius by centrifugal forces, resulting in a characteristic reduction of the
        accretion luminosity. The onset of this mechanism, called the propeller, has
        been widely adopted to interpret a distinctive knee in the decaying phase
        of the light curve of several transiently accreting X-ray pulsar systems.
        By comparing the observed luminosity at the knee for different classes of

        measured magnetic field, spin period, mass, and radius of the star, we disclose

        paper generalizes to circular apertures the theoretical study of stellar coronagraphy

        The main difference between the two studies is that circular prolate spheroidal
        functions are used for a circular aperture instead of linear prolate spheroidal
        functions for rectangular apertures. Owing to the radial property of the problem,
        the solution to the general equation for coronagraphy is solved using a Hankel
        transform instead of a product of Fourier transforms in the rectangular case.
        This new theoretical study permits a better understanding of coronagraphy,
        stressing the importance of entrance pupil apodization. A comparison with
        the classical unapodized Lyot technique is performed: a typical gain of 10<SUP>4</SUP>
        to 10<SUP>6</SUP> can be obtained theoretically with this technique. Circular
        and rectangular apertures give overall comparable results: a total extinction

        whilst optimal starlight rejections are obtained with a Lyot opaque mask.

        J1227.7-4853. Multi-wavelength observations have added information on this
        source, indicating a low-luminosity low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), but its
        nature is still unclear. <BR /> Aims: To progress in our understanding, we
        present new X-ray data from a monitoring campaign performed in 2011 with the
        XMM-Newton, RXTE, and Swift satellites and combine them with new gamma-ray
        data from the Fermi and AGILE satellites. We complement the study with simultaneous
        near-UV photometry from XMM-Newton and with previous UV/optical and near-IR
        data. <BR /> Methods: We analysed the temporal characteristics in the X-rays,
        near-UV, and gamma rays and studied the broad-band spectral energy distribution
        from radio to gamma rays. <BR /> Results: The X-ray history of XSS J1227 over
        7 yr shows a persistent and rather stable low-luminosity (6 \xD7 10<SUP>33</SUP>
        d<SUB>1 kpc</SUB><SUP>2</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) source, with flares and
        dips being peculiar and permanent characteristics. The associated Fermi-LAT
        source 2FGL J1227.7-4853 is also stable over an overlapping period of 4.7
        yr. Searches for X-ray fast pulsations down to msec give upper limits to pulse
        fractional amplitudes of 15-25% that do not rule out a fast spinning pulsar.
        The combined UV/optical/near-IR spectrum reveals a hot component at ~13 kK
        and a cool one at ~4.6 kK. The latter would suggest a late-type K2-K5 companion
        star, a distance range of 1.4-3.6 kpc, and an orbital period of 7-9 h. A near-UV
        variability (\u22736 h) also suggests a longer orbital period than previously
        estimated. <BR /> Conclusions: The analysis shows that the X-ray and UV/optical/near-IR
        emissions are more compatible with an accretion-powered compact object than
        with a rotational powered pulsar. The X-ray to UV bolometric luminosity ratio
        could be consistent with a binary hosting a neutron star, but the uncertainties
        in the radio data may also allow an LMXB black hole with a compact jet. In
        this case, it would be the first associated with a high-energy gamma-ray source.

        XSS J1227.0-4859 is a peculiar, hard X-ray source recently positionally associated
        to the Fermi-LAT source 1FGL J1227.9-4852/2FGL J1227.7-4853. Multi-wavelength
        observations have added information on this source, indicating a low-luminosity
        low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), but its nature is still unclear. <BR /> Aims:
        To progress in our understanding, we present new X-ray data from a monitoring
        campaign performed in 2011 with the XMM-Newton, RXTE, and Swift satellites
        and combine them with new gamma-ray data from the Fermi and AGILE satellites.
        We complement the study with simultaneous near-UV photometry from XMM-Newton
        and with previous UV/optical and near-IR data. <BR /> Methods: We analysed
        the temporal characteristics in the X-rays, near-UV, and gamma rays and studied
        the broad-band spectral energy distribution from radio to gamma rays. <BR
        /> Results: The X-ray history of XSS J1227 over 7 yr shows a persistent and
        rather stable low-luminosity (6 \xD7 10<SUP>33</SUP> d<SUB>1 kpc</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>
        erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) source, with flares and dips being peculiar and permanent
        characteristics. The associated Fermi-LAT source 2FGL J1227.7-4853 is also
        stable over an overlapping period of 4.7 yr. Searches for X-ray fast pulsations
        down to msec give upper limits to pulse fractional amplitudes of 15-25% that
        do not rule out a fast spinning pulsar. The combined UV/optical/near-IR spectrum
        reveals a hot component at ~13 kK and a cool one at ~4.6 kK. The latter would
        suggest a late-type K2-K5 companion star, a distance range of 1.4-3.6 kpc,
        and an orbital period of 7-9 h. A near-UV variability (\u22736 h) also suggests
        a longer orbital period than previously estimated. <BR /> Conclusions: The
        analysis shows that the X-ray and UV/optical/near-IR emissions are more compatible
        with an accretion-powered compact object than with a rotational powered pulsar.
        The X-ray to UV bolometric luminosity ratio could be consistent with a binary
        hosting a neutron star, but the uncertainties in the radio data may also allow
        an LMXB black hole with a compact jet. In this case, it would be the first
        associated with a high-energy gamma-ray source. <P />Based on observations

        We present a multi-wavelength analysis of PSR J1023+0038, which reveals that
        (1) its gamma-rays suddenly brightened within a few days in 2013 June/July
        and has remained at a high gamma-ray state for several months; (2) both UV
        and X-ray fluxes have increased by roughly an order of magnitude; and (3)
        the spectral energy distribution has changed significantly after the gamma-ray
        sudden flux change. Time variabilities associated with UV and X-rays are on
        the order of 100-500 s and 50-100 s, respectively. Our model suggests that
        a newly formed accretion disk, due to the sudden increase of the stellar wind,
        could explain the changes of all these observed features. The increase of
        UV is emitted from the disk, and a new component in gamma-rays is produced
        by inverse Compton scattering between the new UV component and pulsar wind.
        The increase of X-rays results from the enhancement of injection pulsar wind
        energy into the intra-binary shock due to the increase of the stellar wind.

        of observational data for understanding accretion at low rates onto magnetized
        neutron stars. In particular, PSR J1023+0038 exhibits a remarkable bimodality
        of the X-ray luminosity (low and high modes), pulsations extending from the
        X-ray to the optical band, GeV emission, and occasional X-ray flares. We discuss
        a scenario for the pulsar interaction with the accretion disk capable of explaining
        the observed behavior. We suggest that during the high mode the disk is truncated
        outside the light cylinder, allowing the pulsar wind to develop near the equatorial
        plane and strike the disk. The dissipative wind-disk collision energizes the
        disk particles and generates synchrotron emission, which peaks in the X-ray
        band and extends down to the optical band. The emission is modulated by the
        pulsar wind rotation, resulting in a pulse profile with two peaks 180\xB0
        apart. This picture explains the high mode luminosity, spectrum, and pulse
        profile (X-ray and optical) of PSR J1023+0038. It may also explain the X-ray
        flares as events of sudden increase in the effective disk cross section intercepting
        the wind. In contrast to previously proposed models, we suggest that the disk
        penetrates the light cylinder only during the low X-ray mode. This penetration
        suppresses the dissipation caused by the pulsar wind-disk collision, and the
        system enters the propeller regime. The small duty cycle of the propeller

        grating in quasi-Littrow mode and in white pupil configuration. With two fibers
        of 100 micrometer core diameter for the object and the nearby sky, the complete
        optical spectrum from 370 - 860 nm is recorded in one single exposure on a
        2k X 4k thinned CCD with 15 micrometer pixels. Therefore, the instrument can
        work in a fixed configuration on the optical bench without movable parts besides
        the CCD shutter mechanics. For the highest-possible opto-mechanical stability.
        FEROS will be housed in a temperature and humidity controlled room in the
        former Coude room of the telescope. The resolving power of R equals 48,000
        is reached by the use of a newly designed two-slice image slicer which is
        fed by the two fibers. Alternatively, the sky fiber can be illuminated with
        a calibration lamp during the whole object exposure to monitor the spectrograph's

        is still unclear. It was claimed to be a possible magnetic cataclysmic variable
        of the Intermediate Polar type from its optical spectrum and a possible 860
        s X-ray periodicity in RXTE data. However, recent observations do not support
        the latter variability, leaving this X-ray source still unclassified. <BR
        /> Aims: To investigate its nature we present a broad-band X-ray and gamma
        ray study of this source based on a recent XMM-Newton observation and archival
        INTEGRAL and RXTE data. Using the Fermi/LAT 1-year point source catalogue,
        we tentatively associate XSS J12270-4859 with 1FGL J1227.9-4852, a source
        of high-energy gamma rays with emission up to 10 GeV. We further complement
        the study with UV photometry from XMM-Newton and ground-based optical and
        near-IR photometry. <BR /> Methods: We have analysed both timing and spectral
        properties in the gamma rays, X-rays, UV and optical/near-IR bands of XSS
        J12270-4859. <BR /> Results: The X-ray emission is highly variable, showing
        flares and intensity dips. The flares consist of flare-dip pairs. Flares are
        detected in both X-rays and the UV range, while the subsequent dips are present
        only in the X-ray band. Further aperiodic dipping behaviour is observed during
        X-ray quiescence, but not in the UV. The broad-band 0.2-100 keV X-ray/soft
        gamma ray spectrum is featureless and well described by a power law model
        with \u0393 = 1.7. The high-energy spectrum from 100 MeV to 10 GeV is represented
        by a power law index of 2.45. The luminosity ratio between 0.1-100 GeV and
        0.2-100 keV is ~0.8, indicating that the GeV emission is a significant component
        of the total energy output. Furthermore, the X-ray spectrum does not greatly
        change during flares, quiescence and the dips seen in quiescence. The X-ray
        spectrum however hardens during the post-flare dips, where a partial covering
        absorber is also required to fit the spectrum. Optical photometry acquired
        at different epochs reveals a period of 4.32 hr that could be ascribed to
        the binary orbital period. Near-IR, possibly ellipsoidal, variations are detected.
        Large amplitude variability on shorter (tens mins) timescales is found to
        be non-periodic. <BR /> Conclusions: The observed variability at all wavelengths
        together with the spectral characteristics strongly favour a low-mass atypical
        low-luminosity X-ray binary and are against a magnetic cataclysmic variable
        nature. The association with a Fermi/LAT high-energy gamma ray source further
        strengths this interpretation. <P />Based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton

        binary millisecond radio pulsar PSR J1023+0038 has been recently the subject
        of multiwavelength monitoring campaigns which revealed that an accretion disc
        has formed around the neutron star (since 2013 June). We present here the
        results of X-ray and UV observations carried out by the Swift satellite between
        2013 October and 2014 May, and of optical and NIR observations performed with
        the REM telescope, the Liverpool Telescope, the 2.1-m telescope at the San
        Pedro M\xE1rtir Observatory and the 1.52-m telescope at the Loiano observing
        station. The X-ray spectrum is well described by an absorbed power law, which
        is softer than the previous quiescent epoch (up to 2013 June). The strong
        correlation between the X-ray and the UV emissions indicates that the same
        mechanism should be responsible for part of the emission in these bands. Optical
        and infrared photometric observations show that the companion star is strongly
        irradiated. Double-peaked emission lines in the optical spectra provide compelling
        evidence for the presence of an outer accretion disc too. The spectral energy
        distribution from IR to X-rays is well modelled if the contributions from
        the companion, the disc and the intrabinary shock emission are all considered.
        Our extensive data set can be interpreted in terms of an engulfed radio pulsar:
        the radio pulsar is still active, but undetectable in the radio band due to
        a large amount of ionized material surrounding the compact object. X-rays
        and gamma-rays are produced in an intrabinary shock front between the relativistic
        pulsar wind and matter from the companion and an outer accretion disc. The
        intense spin-down power irradiates the disc and the companion star, accounting

        the last 20 years our understanding of the millisecond pulsar population changed
        dramatically. Thanks to the large effective area and good time resolution
        of the NASA X-ray observatory Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, we discovered that
        neutron stars in Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) spins at frequencies between
        200 and 750 Hz, and indirectly confirmed the recycling scenario, according
        to which neutron stars are spun up to millisecond periods during the LMXB-phase.
        In the meantime, the continuous discovery of rotation-powered millisecond
        pulsars in binary systems in the radio and gamma-ray band (mainly with the
        Fermi Large Area Telescope) allowed us to classify these sources into two
        \\\"spiders\\\" populations, depending on the mass of their companion stars:
        Black Widow pulsars, with very low-mass companion stars, and Redbacks, with
        larger mass companion stars possibly filling their Roche lobes without accretion
        of matter onto the neutron star. It was soon regained that millisecond pulsars
        in short orbital period LMXBs are the progenitors of the spider populations
        of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, although a direct link between accretion-powered
        and rotation-powered millisecond pulsars was still missing. In 2013 the ESA
        X-ray observatory XMM-Newton spotted the X-ray outburst of a new accreting
        millisecond pulsar (IGR J18245-2452) in a source that was previously classified
        as a radio millisecond pulsar, probably of the Redback type. Follow up observations
        of the source when it went back to X-ray quiescence showed that it was able
        to swing between accretion-powered to rotation-powered pulsations in a relatively
        short timescale (few days), promoting this source as the direct link between
        the LMXB and the radio millisecond pulsar phases. Following discoveries showed
        that there exists a bunch of sources which alternates X-ray activity phases,
        showing X-ray coherent pulsations, to radio-loud phases, showing radio pulsations,
        establishing a new class of millisecond pulsars, the so-called transitional
        millisecond pulsars. In this review we describe these exciting discoveries
        and the properties of accreting and transitional millisecond pulsars, highlighting
        what we know and what we have still to learn about in order to fully understand
        the (sometime puzzling) behaviour of these systems and their evolutive connection.\",\n

        J0422+32, GS 2000+25, and Cen X-4. We detect fast optical variations superposed
        on the secondary star's double-humped ellipsoidal modulation. The variability
        resembles typical flare activity and has amplitudes ranging from 0.06 to 0.6
        mag. Flares occur on timescales of minutes to a few hours, with no dependency
        on orbital phase, and contribute ~19%-46% to the total veiling observed in
        the R band. We find that the observed level of flaring activity is veiled
        by the light of the companion star, and therefore, systems with cool companions
        (e.g., J0422+32) exhibit stronger variability. After correcting for this dilution,
        we do not find any correlation between the flaring activity and fundamental
        system parameters. We find no underlying coherent periods in the data, only
        quasi-periodic variations ranging between 30 and 90 minutes for the short-period
        SXTs and longer than 1 hr for V404 Cyg. The power-law index of the power spectra
        is consistent with what is observed at X-rays wavelengths, i.e., a 1/f distribution,
        which is compatible with the cellular automaton model. Our observed R'-band
        luminosities, which are in the range 10<SUP>31</SUP>-10<SUP>33</SUP> ergs

        (AM Herculis or DQ Herculis type) CV. Five nights of optical CCD photometry
        showed variations on timescales of minutes to hours, along with rapid flickering.
        A reexamination of the FIRST radio-survey data reveals that the radio detection
        was based on a single 6.6 mJy flare; on two other occasions, the source was
        below the ~1 mJy survey limit. Several other magnetic CVs are known to be
        variable radio sources, suggesting that FIRST J1023+0038 is a new member of
        this class (and the first CV to be discovered on the basis of radio emission).
        However, FIRST J1023+0038 is several optical magnitudes fainter than the other
        radio-detected magnetic CVs. It remains unclear whether the source simply
        had a very rare and extraordinarily intense radio flare at the time of the
        FIRST observation, or is really an unusually radio-luminous CV; thus, further
        observations are urged.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Bond, Howard E.\",\n          \"White,

        the molecular abundances to within several orders of magnitude are thwarted
        by the broad range of degenerate solutions that fit the data. Here we explore,
        with radiative transfer models and analytical approximations, the nature of
        the degenerate solution sets resulting from the sparse measurements of \\\"hot
        Jupiter\\\" exoplanets. As demonstrated with simple analytical expressions,
        primary transit measurements probe roughly 4 atmospheric scale heights at
        each wavelength band. Derived mixing ratios from these data are highly sensitive
        to errors in the radius in planet (at a reference pressure), which are approximately
        a few percent. For example, an uncertainty of 1% in the radius of a 1000 K
        and H2-based exoplanet with Jupiter's radius and mass, causes an uncertainty
        of a factor of ~100-10000 in the derived gas mixing ratios. The degree of
        sensitivity depends on how the line strength increases with the optical depth
        (i.e. the curve of growth) and the atmospheric scale height. Temperature degeneracies
        in the solutions of the primary transit data, which manifest their effects
        through scale height and absorption coefficients, are smaller. We argue that
        these challenges can be partially surmounted by a combination of selected

        Here, we present the results of the analysis of recent INTEGRAL observations,
        aimed at assessing the long-term variability of the hard X-ray emission, and
        thus the stability of the accretion state. We confirm that the source behaves

        XSS J12270-4859 hosts a neutron star in a propeller state, a state we investigate
        in detail, developing a theoretical model to reproduce the associated X-ray
        and gamma-ray properties. This model can be understood as being of a more
        general nature, representing a viable alternative by which LMXBs can appear
        as gamma-ray sources. In particular, this may apply to the case of millisecond
        pulsars performing a transition from a state powered by the rotation of their
        magnetic field to a state powered by matter infall, such as that recently
        observed from the transitional pulsar PSR J1023+0038. While the surface magnetic
        field of a typical neutron star (NS) in an LMXB is lower by more than four
        orders of magnitude than the much more intense fields of neutron stars accompanying
        high-mass binaries, the radius at which the matter inflow is truncated in
        an NS-LMXB system is much smaller. The magnetic field at the magnetospheric
        interface is then orders of magnitude larger at this interface, and as consequence,
        so is the power to accelerate electrons. We demonstrate that the cooling of
        the accelerated electron population takes place mainly through synchrotron
        interaction with the magnetic field permeating the interface, and through
        inverse Compton losses due to the interaction between the electrons and the
        synchrotron photons they emit. We found that self-synchrotron Compton processes

        <BR />Aims: We attempt to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of binary
        apodizers for the APLC. This study is also relevant to coronagraph using amplitude

        process, where the binary array of pixels with either 0% or 100% transmission
        was calculated to fit the required continuous transmission, i.e. local transmission
        control was obtained by varying the relative density of the opaque and transparent

        the two transitional pulsars PSR J1023+0038 and XSS J12270-4859. This work
        is focused on the search for intrinsically linearly polarised optical emission
        from the two systems. To this aim, we carried out multiband optical (BVRi)
        and near-infrared (NIR; JHK) photo-polarimetric observations of the two systems
        using the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) at La Silla (Chile), equipped
        with the EFOSC2 and the SOFI instruments. The system XSS J12270-4859 was observed
        during its radio-pulsar state; we did not detect a significant degree of polarisation
        in any of the bands, with 3\u03C3 upper limits, for example, of 1.4% in the
        R-band. We built the NIR-optical averaged spectral energy distribution (SED)
        of the system, which could be described well by an irradiated black body with
        radius R<SUB>\u2217</SUB> = 0.33 \xB1 0.03 R<SUB>\u2299</SUB> and albedo \u03B7
        = 0.32 \xB1 0.05, without the need for further components. Thus, we excluded
        the visible presence of an extended accretion disc and/or of relativistic
        jets. The case was different for PSR J1023+0038, which was in its accretion
        phase during our campaign. We measured a linear polarisation of 1.09 \xB1
        0.27% and 0.90 \xB1 0.17% in the V and R bands, respectively. The phase-resolved
        polarimetric curve of the source in the R band reveals a hint of a sinusoidal
        modulation at the source 4.75 h orbital period, peaked at the same orbital
        phase as the light curve. The measured optical polarisation of PSR J1023+0038
        could, in principle, be interpreted as electron scattering with free electrons,
        which can be found in the accretion disc of the system or even in the hot
        corona that sorrounds the disc itself, or as synchrotron emission from a jet
        of relativistic particles or an outflow. However, the NIR-optical SED of the
        system built from our dataset did not suggest the presence of a jet. We conclude
        that the optical linear polarisation observed for PSR J1023+0038 is possibly
        due to Thomson scattering with electrons in the disc, as is also suggested
        from the possible modulation of the R-band linear polarisation at the system
        orbital period. <P />Based on observations made with European Southern Observatory

        self-healing protective coatings with nanocontainers of corrosion inhibitors
        open new opportunities for long-term anticorrosion protection of different
        metallic materials. In this paper a new type of functional nanoreservoir based
        on silica nanocapsules (SiNC) synthesized and loaded with corrosion inhibitor
        2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) in a one-stage process is reported for the first
        time. Unlike conventional mesoporous silica nanoparticles, SiNC possess an
        empty core and shell with gradual mesoporosity, arising from the particular
        conditions of the synthetic route adopted, which confers significant loading
        capacity and allows prolonged and stimuli-triggered release of the inhibiting
        species. The kinetics of inhibitor release was studied at different pH values
        and concentrations of NaCl. The results show a clear dependence of the release
        profiles on corrosion relevant triggers such as pH and Cl<SUP>-</SUP> concentration.
        When SiNC loaded with MBT are dispersed in NaCl solution, there is a significant
        decrease of the corrosion activity on aluminium alloy 2024. More importantly,
        when SiNC-MBT is added to a conventional water-based coating formulation,
        the modified coating hampers corrosion activity at the metal interface, better
        than in the case of direct addition of corrosion inhibitor. Furthermore, self-healing
        is observed before and after artificially inflicting defects in the modified
        coatings. As a result, the developed nanocontainers show high potential to

        Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.62. The luminosity distances
        of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN
        Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our
        High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded
        set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used
        to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble
        constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (i.e.,
        the vacuum energy density, Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0),
        and the dynamical age of the universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift
        SNe Ia are, on average, 10%-15% farther than expected in a low mass density
        (Omega_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light
        curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously
        favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e.,
        Omega_Lambda &gt; 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0
        &lt; 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M &gt;=
        0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with
        q_0 &lt; 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda
        &gt; 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different
        fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M
        = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega_Lambda &gt; 0 at the 3.0 sigma
        confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega_M
        + Omega_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda
        &gt; 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two
        different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M
        = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for
        the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe
        to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid
        distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic
        error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample
        selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing,
        and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile
        the data with Omega_Lambda = 0 and q_0 &gt;= 0.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Riess,

        paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations
        of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background
        (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis
        of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision.
        The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard
        spatially-flat 6-parameter \u039BCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of
        adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted \\\"base \u039BCDM\\\" in this paper).
        From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology
        we find a Hubble constant, H<SUB>0</SUB> = (67.8 \xB1 0.9) km s<SUP>-1</SUP>Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>,
        a matter density parameter \u03A9<SUB>m</SUB> = 0.308 \xB1 0.012, and a tilted
        scalar spectral index with n<SUB>s</SUB> = 0.968 \xB1 0.006, consistent with
        the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68% confidence limits
        on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters. We present
        the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument
        at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing
        data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of \u03C4 = 0.066
        \xB1 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of z_re=8.8<SUP>+1.7</SUP><SUB>-1.4</SUB>.
        These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements
        cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency
        Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base \u039BCDM in the
        neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations
        with other astrophysical data we find N<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3.15 \xB1 0.23 for
        the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the
        value N<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The
        sum of neutrino masses is constrained to \u2211 m<SUB>\u03BD</SUB> &lt; 0.23
        eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero,
        with | \u03A9<SUB>K</SUB> | &lt; 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter
        extension to base \u039BCDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar
        ratio of r<SUB>0.002</SUB>&lt; 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results
        and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis
        of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to
        our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of r<SUB>0.002</SUB> &lt; 0.09
        and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V(\u03C6) \u221D \u03C6<SUP>2</SUP>
        potential. The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints
        on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no
        evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic
        defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type
        Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w =
        -1.006 \xB1 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant.
        The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium
        abundances for the best-fit Planck base \u039BCDM cosmology are in excellent
        agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter
        and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither
        case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base \u039BCDM
        are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA
        sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude
        of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some
        analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that
        these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the
        base \u039BCDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base \u039BCDM cosmology
        provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many
        other astrophysical data sets. <P /></SUP>\",\n        \"author\":[\"Planck

        the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero

        have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting
        states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination
        of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional
        (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close
        cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological
        insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface.
        In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and
        superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which
        the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments
        on HgTe/CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of
        the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments

        materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of
        their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface
        of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap
        leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric
        effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana
        fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological
        quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also
        discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.\",\n

        exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free
        (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations
        to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and
        correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction
        correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the
        self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational
        principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although
        the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential,
        the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply
        the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content
        of the exchange-correlation hole, while substantially improving the description
        of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where
        the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic
        improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction.
        Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the

        is a toolkit for simulating the passage of particles through matter. It includes
        a complete range of functionality including tracking, geometry, physics models
        and hits. The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including
        electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived
        particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some
        cases, from 250 eV and extending in others to the TeV energy range. It has
        been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle
        complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different
        sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration
        of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software
        engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming
        language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics,
        accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Agostinelli,

        \       \"abstract\":\"The phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation of dilute
        gases in traps is reviewed from a theoretical perspective. Mean-field theory
        provides a framework to understand the main features of the condensation and
        the role of interactions between particles. Various properties of these systems
        are discussed, including the density profiles and the energy of the ground-state
        configurations, the collective oscillations and the dynamics of the expansion,
        the condensate fraction and the thermodynamic functions. The thermodynamic
        limit exhibits a scaling behavior in the relevant length and energy scales.
        Despite the dilute nature of the gases, interactions profoundly modify the
        static as well as the dynamic properties of the system; the predictions of
        mean-field theory are in excellent agreement with available experimental results.
        Effects of superfluidity including the existence of quantized vortices and
        the reduction of the moment of inertia are discussed, as well as the consequences
        of coherence such as the Josephson effect and interference phenomena. The
        review also assesses the accuracy and limitations of the mean-field approach.\",\n

        \       \"abstract\":\"Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme
        of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved
        in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was
        changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload
        were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community
        focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing
        and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on
        19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point
        of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the
        spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year
        mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently
        transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of
        Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016)
        being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload
        module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance
        of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings,
        followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific
        performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate
        Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia
        Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. <P /><A href=\\\"http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia\\\">http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia</A>\",\n

        all sky surveys done by the Palomar Observatory Schmidt, the European Southern
        Observatory Schmidt, and the United Kingdom Schmidt, the InfraRed Astronomical
        Satellite, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey have proven to be extremely useful
        tools for astronomy with value that lasts for decades. The Wide-field Infrared
        Survey Explorer (WISE) is mapping the whole sky following its launch on 2009
        December 14. WISE began surveying the sky on 2010 January 14 and completed
        its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to

        self-interacting, homogeneous scalar field are investigated. A number of models
        in which the energy density of the scalar field red-shifts in a specific manner

        dominated to agree with dynamical estimates of the density parameter, \u03A9<SUB>dyn~0.2</SUB>,

        inhibits the growth of perturbations in the baryonic fluid. The energy density
        in the scalar field is not appreciably perturbed by nonrelativistic gravitational
        fields, either in the radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, or scalar-field-dominated

        and gravity requires the three-dimensional world to be an image of data that
        can be stored on a two-dimensional projection much like a holographic image.
        The two-dimensional description only requires one discrete degree of freedom
        per Planck area and yet it is rich enough to describe all three-dimensional
        phenomena. After outlining 't Hooft's proposal we give a preliminary informal
        description of how it may be implemented. One finds a basic requirement that
        particles must grow in size as their momenta are increased far above the Planck
        scale. The consequences for high-energy particle collisions are described.
        The phenomenon of particle growth with momentum was previously discussed in
        the context of string theory and was related to information spreading near
        black hole horizons. The considerations of this paper indicate that the effect
        is much more rapid at all but the earliest times. In fact the rate of spreading
        is found to saturate the bound from causality. Finally we consider string
        theory as a possible realization of 't Hooft's idea. The light front lattice
        string model of Klebanov and Susskind is reviewed and its similarities with
        the holographic theory are demonstrated. The agreement between the two requires

        earthquake model is derived by considering the effective stress available
        to accelerate the sides of the fault. The model describes near- and far-field
        displacement-time functions and spectra and includes the effect of fractional
        stress drop. It successfully explains the near- and far-field spectra observed
        for earthquakes and indicates that effective stresses are of the order of
        100 bars. For this stress, the estimated upper limit of near-fault particle
        velocity is 100 cm/sec, and the estimated upper limit for accelerations is
        approximately 2g at 10 Hz and proportionally lower for lower frequencies.
        The near field displacement u is approximately given by u(t) = (\u03C3/\u03BC)
        \u03B2r(1 - e<SUP>-t/r</SUP>) where. \u03C3 is the effective stress, \u03BC
        is the rigidity, \u03B2 is the shear wave velocity, and \u03C4 is of the order
        of the dimension of the fault divided by the shear-wave velocity. The corresponding
        spectrum is\u03A9(\u03C9)=\u03C3\u03B2\u03BC1\u03C9(\u03C92+\u03C4-2)1/2The

        &lt;R<SUB>\u03B8\u03D5</SUB>&gt; is the rms average of the radiation pattern;

        \u025B is the fraction of stress drop; and \u03B1 = 2.21 \u03B2/r. The rms
        spectrum falls off as (\u03C9/\u03B1)<SUP>-2</SUP> at very high frequencies.
        For values of \u03C9/\u03B1 between 1 and 10 the rms spectrum falls off as

        formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics whereby the behavior of a
        system of interest, which is coupled to other external quantum systems, may
        be calculated in terms of its own variables only. It is shown that the effect
        of the external systems in such a formalism can always be included in a general
        class of functionals (influence functionals) of the coordinates of the system
        only. The properties of influence functionals for general systems are examined.
        Then, specific forms of influence functionals representing the effect of definite
        and random classical forces, linear dissipative systems at finite temperatures,
        and combinations of these are analyzed in detail. The linear system analysis
        is first done for perfectly linear systems composed of combinations of harmonic
        oscillators, loss being introduced by continuous distributions of oscillators.
        Then approximately linear systems and restrictions necessary for the linear
        behavior are considered. Influence functionals for all linear systems are
        shown to have the same form in terms of their classical response functions.
        In addition, a fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived relating temperature
        and dissipation of the linear system to a fluctuating classical potential
        acting on the system of interest which reduces to the Nyquist-Johnson relation
        for noise in the case of electric circuits. Sample calculations of transition
        probabilities for the spontaneous emission of an atom in free space and in
        a cavity are made. Finally, a theorem is proved showing that within the requirements

        of the orbital parameters of 231 transiting giant planets (TGPs) that are
        alone or have distant companions; we employed differential evolution Markov
        chain Monte Carlo methods to analyse radial-velocity (RV) data from the literature
        and 782 new high-accuracy RVs obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph for 45
        systems over 3 years. Our work yields the largest sample of systems with a
        transiting giant exoplanet and coherently determined orbital, planetary, and
        stellar parameters. We found that the orbital parameters of TGPs in non-compact
        planetary systems are clearly shaped by tides raised by their host stars.
        Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital separations
        and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide theory. This
        feature would be the outcome of planetary migration from highly eccentric
        orbits excited by planet-planet scattering, Kozai-Lidov perturbations, or
        secular chaos. The distribution of \u03B1 = a/a<SUB>R</SUB>, where a and a<SUB>R</SUB>
        are the semi-major axis and the Roche limit, for well-determined circular
        orbits peaks at 2.5; this agrees with expectations from the high-eccentricity
        migration (HEM), although it might not be limited to this migration scenario.
        The few planets of our sample with circular orbits and \u03B1&gt; 5 values
        may have migrated through disc-planet interactions instead of HEM. By comparing
        circularisation times with stellar ages, we found that hot Jupiters with a&lt;
        0.05 au have modified tidal quality factors 10<SUP>5</SUP> \u2272 Q'<SUB>p</SUB>
        \u2272 10<SUP>9</SUP>, and that stellar Q'<SUB>s</SUB> \u2273 10<SUP>6</SUP>
        - 10<SUP>7</SUP> are required to explain the presence of eccentric planets
        at the same orbital distance. As aby-product of our analysis, we detected
        a non-zero eccentricity e = 0.104<SUB>-0.018</SUB><SUP>+0.021</SUP> for HAT-P-29;
        we determined that five planets that were previously regarded to be eccentric
        or to have hints of non-zero eccentricity, namely CoRoT-2b, CoRoT-23b, TrES-3b,
        HAT-P-23b, and WASP-54b, have circular orbits or undetermined eccentricities;
        we unveiled curvatures caused by distant companions in the RV time series
        of HAT-P-2, HAT-P-22, and HAT-P-29; we significantly improved the orbital
        parameters of the long-period planet HAT-P-17c; and we revised the planetary
        parameters of CoRoT-1b, which turned out to be considerably more inflated

        surface ocean circulation obtained by merging TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) and ERS-1
        and -2 altimeter measurements between October 1992 and May 1998. Once carefully
        intercalibrated and homogenized, these data are merged through an advanced
        global objective analysis method that allows us to correct for residual long
        wavelength errors and uses realistic correlation scales of ocean dynamics.
        The high-resolution (0.25\xB0\xD70.25\xB0) merged T/P+ERS-1 and -2 sea level
        anomaly maps provide more homogeneous and reduced mapping errors than either
        individual data set and more realistic sea level and geostrophic velocity
        statistics than T/P data alone. Furthermore, the merged T/P+ERS-1 and -2 maps
        yield eddy kinetic energy (EKE) levels 30% higher than maps of T/P alone.
        They also permit realistic global estimates of east and north components of
        EKE and their seasonal variations, to study EKE sources better. A comparison
        of velocity statistics with World Ocean Circulation Experiment surface drifters
        in the North Atlantic shows very good agreement. Comparison with contemporary
        current meter data in various oceanic regimes also produces comparable levels
        of energy and similar ratios of northward and eastward energy, showing that
        the maps are suitable to studying anisotropy. The T/P + ERS zonal and meridional
        components of the mapped currents usually present comparable rms variability,
        even though the variability in the Atlantic is more isotropic than that in
        the Pacific, which exhibits strong zonal changes. The EKE map presents a very
        detailed description, presumably never before achieved at a global scale.
        Pronounced seasonal changes of the EKE are found in many regions, notably
        the northeastern Pacific, the northeastern and northwestern Atlantic, the
        tropical oceans, and the zonally extended bands centered near 20\xB0S in the

        Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget,
        and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In
        this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully
        balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance.
        Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly
        scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly
        effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method
        on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture
        search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family
        of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency
        than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art
        84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster
        on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer
        well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%),

        \       \"abstract\":\"Determining the architecture of multi-planetary systems
        is one of the cornerstones of understanding planet formation and evolution.
        Resonant systems are especially important as the fragility of their orbital
        configuration ensures that no significant scattering or collisional event
        has taken place since the earliest formation phase when the parent protoplanetary
        disc was still present. In this context, TOI-178 has been the subject of particular
        attention since the first TESS observations hinted at the possible presence
        of a near 2:3:3 resonant chain. Here we report the results of observations
        from CHEOPS, ESPRESSO, NGTS, and SPECULOOS with the aim of deciphering the
        peculiar orbital architecture of the system. We show that TOI-178 harbours
        at least six planets in the super-Earth to mini-Neptune regimes, with radii
        ranging from 1.152<SUB>\u22120.070</SUB><SUP>+0.073</SUP> to 2.87<SUB>\u22120.13</SUB><SUP>+0.14</SUP>
        Earth radii and periods of 1.91, 3.24, 6.56, 9.96, 15.23, and 20.71 days.
        All planets but the innermost one form a 2:4:6:9:12 chain of Laplace resonances,
        and the planetary densities show important variations from planet to planet,
        jumping from 1.02<SUB>\u22120.23</SUB><SUP>+0.28</SUP> to 0.177<SUB>\u22120.061</SUB><SUP>+0.055</SUP>
        times the Earth's density between planets c and d. Using Bayesian interior
        structure retrieval models, we show that the amount of gas in the planets
        does not vary in a monotonous way, contrary to what one would expect from
        simple formation and evolution models and unlike other known systems in a
        chain of Laplace resonances. The brightness of TOI-178 (H = 8.76 mag, J =
        9.37 mag, V = 11.95 mag) allows for a precise characterisation of its orbital
        architecture as well as of the physical nature of the six presently known
        transiting planets it harbours. The peculiar orbital configuration and the
        diversity in average density among the planets in the system will enable the
        study of interior planetary structures and atmospheric evolution, providing
        important clues on the formation of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Leleu,

        manipulating the magnetization of nanodevices, and give rise to spin transfer
        torques that can drive magnetic domain walls along nanowires. In ultrathin
        magnetic wires, domain walls are found to move in the opposite direction to
        that expected from bulk spin transfer torques, and also at much higher speeds.
        Here we show that this is due to two intertwined phenomena, both derived from

        current-driven domain-wall motion in perpendicularly magnetized Co/Ni/Co trilayers,
        we find an internal effective magnetic field acting on each domain wall, the
        direction of which alternates between successive domain walls. This chiral
        effective field arises from a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction at the Co/Pt
        interfaces and, in concert with spin Hall currents, drives the domain walls
        in lock-step along the nanowire. Elucidating the mechanism for the manipulation

        `hard' directions of the magnetization. This magnetic anisotropy is, from
        both a technological and fundamental viewpoint one of the most important properties
        of magnetic materials. The magnetic anisotropy in metallic magnetic multilayers
        forms the subject of this review article. As individual layers in a multilayer
        stack become thinner, the role of interfaces and surfaces may dominate that
        of the bulk: this is the case in many magnetic multilayers, where a perpendicular
        interface contribution to the magnetic anisotropy is capable of rotating the
        easy magnetization direction from in the film plane to perpendicular to the
        film plane. In this review, we show that the (in-plane) volume and (perpendicular)
        interface contribution to the magnetic anisotropy have been separated into
        terms related to mechanical stresses, crystallographic structure and the planar
        shape of the films. In addition, the effect of roughness, often inherent to
        the deposition techniques used, has been addressed theoretically. Several
        techniques to prepare multilayers and to characterize their growth as well
        as methods to determine the magnetic anisotropy are discussed. A comprehensive

        Two major subjects of this review are the extrinsic effects of strain, roughness
        and interdiffusion and the intrinsic effect of the crystallographic orientation
        on the magnetic anisotropy. Both effects are investigated with the help of
        some dedicated experimental studies. The results of the orientational dependence

        this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning
        and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial
        practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or
        'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous
        convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature
        responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also
        allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate
        larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of
        computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly
        segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional
        feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views,
        thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third,
        we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from
        DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination
        of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll
        on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the
        final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which
        is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance.

        has been suggested that an advanced civilization might have the technology
        to warp spacetime so that closed timelike curves would appear, allowing travel
        into the past. This paper examines this possibility in the case that the causality
        violations appear in a finite region of spacetime without curvature singularities.
        There will be a Cauchy horizon that is compactly generated and that in general
        contains one or more closed null geodesics which will be incomplete. One can
        define geometrical quantities that measure the Lorentz boost and area increase
        on going round these closed null geodesics. If the causality violation developed
        from a noncompact initial surface, the averaged weak energy condition must
        be violated on the Cauchy horizon. This shows that one cannot create closed
        timelike curves with finite lengths of cosmic string. Even if violations of
        the weak energy condition are allowed by quantum theory, the expectation value
        of the energy-momentum tensor would get very large if timelike curves become
        almost closed. It seems the back reaction would prevent closed timelike curves
        from appearing. These results strongly support the chronology protection conjecture:

        can glide. Wavefront dislocations may be curved, and they may intersect; they

        learning thrives with large neural networks and large datasets. However, larger
        networks and larger datasets result in longer training times that impede research
        and development progress. Distributed synchronous SGD offers a potential solution
        to this problem by dividing SGD minibatches over a pool of parallel workers.
        Yet to make this scheme efficient, the per-worker workload must be large,
        which implies nontrivial growth in the SGD minibatch size. In this paper,
        we empirically show that on the ImageNet dataset large minibatches cause optimization
        difficulties, but when these are addressed the trained networks exhibit good
        generalization. Specifically, we show no loss of accuracy when training with
        large minibatch sizes up to 8192 images. To achieve this result, we adopt
        a hyper-parameter-free linear scaling rule for adjusting learning rates as
        a function of minibatch size and develop a new warmup scheme that overcomes
        optimization challenges early in training. With these simple techniques, our
        Caffe2-based system trains ResNet-50 with a minibatch size of 8192 on 256
        GPUs in one hour, while matching small minibatch accuracy. Using commodity
        hardware, our implementation achieves ~90% scaling efficiency when moving
        from 8 to 256 GPUs. Our findings enable training visual recognition models
        on internet-scale data with high efficiency.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Goyal,

        ESPRESSO is the new high-resolution spectrograph of ESO's Very Large Telescope
        (VLT). It was designed for ultra-high radial-velocity (RV) precision and extreme
        spectral fidelity with the aim of performing exoplanet research and fundamental
        astrophysical experiments with unprecedented precision and accuracy. It is
        able to observe with any of the four Unit Telescopes (UTs) of the VLT at a
        spectral resolving power of 140 000 or 190 000 over the 378.2 to 788.7 nm
        wavelength range; it can also observe with all four UTs together, turning
        the VLT into a 16 m diameter equivalent telescope in terms of collecting area
        while still providing a resolving power of 70 000. <BR /> Aims: We provide
        a general description of the ESPRESSO instrument, report on its on-sky performance,
        and present our Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program along with its first
        results. <BR /> Methods: ESPRESSO was installed on the Paranal Observatory
        in fall 2017. Commissioning (on-sky testing) was conducted between December
        2017 and September 2018. The instrument saw its official start of operations
        on October 1, 2018, but improvements to the instrument and recommissioning
        runs were conducted until July 2019. <BR /> Results: The measured overall
        optical throughput of ESPRESSO at 550 nm and a seeing of 0.65\u2033 exceeds
        the 10% mark under nominal astroclimatic conditions. We demonstrate an RV
        precision of better than 25 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP> during a single night and 50
        cm s<SUP>-1</SUP> over several months. These values being limited by photon
        noise and stellar jitter shows that the performance is compatible with an
        instrumental precision of 10 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP>. No difference has been measured
        across the UTs, neither in throughput nor RV precision. <BR /> Conclusions:
        The combination of the large collecting telescope area with the efficiency
        and the exquisite spectral fidelity of ESPRESSO opens a new parameter space
        in RV measurements, the study of planetary atmospheres, fundamental constants,
        stellar characterization, and many other fields. <P />Based on GTOs collected

        conductivity, temperature, and depth probes and vector-measuring current meters
        provide a new and detailed look at the diurnal cycle of the upper ocean. A
        diurnal cycle occurs when solar heating warms and stabilizes the upper ocean.
        This limits the downward penetration of turbulent wind mixing so that air-sea
        fluxes of heat and momentum are surface trapped during midday. The central
        problem is to learn how the trapping depth D<SUB>T</SUB> (mean depth value
        of the diurnal temperature and velocity response) is set by the competing
        effects of wind mixing and surface heating. In this data set the diurnal range
        of surface temperature T\u223Cs was observed to vary from 0.05&lt;T\u223Cs&lt;0.4\xB0C,
        with most of the day-to-day variability attributable to variations of wind
        stress \u03C4. Wind mixing causes a pronounced asymmetry of the T<SUB>s</SUB>
        response by limiting the warming phase to only about half of the period that
        the surface heat flux Q is positive. The associated wind-driven current, the
        diurnal jet, has an amplitude of typically V\u223Cs\u22480.1 m s-1, with no
        obvious dependence upon \u03C4. The diurnal jet accelerates downwind during
        the morning and midday. It is turned into the wind by the Coriolis force during
        early evening and is often erased by the following morning. Under the assumption
        that wind mixing occurs as an adjustment to shear flow stability, a scaling
        analysis and a numerical model study show that the daily minimum trapping
        depth D\u223CT goes like \u03C4/Q<SUP>1/2</SUP>. It follows that T\u223Cs
        goes like Q<SUP>3/2</SUP>/\u03C4 and that V\u223Cs goes like Q<SUP>1/2</SUP>.
        These results, as well as the simulated time dependence of the diurnal cycle,
        are at least roughly consistent with the observations. The observed time-averaged
        velocity profile has a spiral shape reminiscent of the classical Ekman spiral.
        However, its structure is a consequence of diurnal cycling, and its parameter
        dependence is in some ways just opposite that of the Ekman model; e.g., increased
        wind stress may cause decreased vertical shear between fixed levels in the
        upper ocean.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Price, James F.\",\n          \"Weller,

        reactions are studied, primarily through the application of scaling approaches.
        Our goal is to investigate the effects of spatial inhomogeneities in the particle
        densities on the reaction kinetics. In general, we find that there exists
        an upper critical dimension below which the kinetics cannot be described by
        a rate-equation analysis, an approach which gives the kinetic laws of a mean-field
        approximation. Below the upper critical dimension, spatial inhomogeneities
        in the particle densities give rise to new fluctuation-dominated kinetics.
        For irreversible reactions, with bimolecular decay A+B--&gt;inert being a
        simple generic example, universal kinetic laws are obtained which are a function
        only of the spatial dimension, the number of particles needed to initiate
        a reaction, and the nature of the particle-conservation laws for the system.
        We also consider the generalization of bimolecular decay to a multistate process
        where particles of variable ``heights'' and traps of variable ``depths'' react.
        This phenomenologically rich example serves as an illustrative testing ground
        for scaling ideas. The introduction of a small reaction probability on bimolecular
        decay provides an example of a dramatic crossover from an initial mean-field
        decay to the fluctuation-dominated decay law at large times. When the possibility
        of a reverse reaction is allowed in bimolecular decay, the available evidence
        suggests that there is a power-law approach to the equilibrium state, rather
        than an exponential approach predicted by the rate equation. Many of our new
        theoretical predictions are tested by extensive numerical simulations.\",\n

        to a localized ground state as the dimensionless friction \u03B1 is raised

        \       \"abstract\":\"This article consists of two parts. The first part
        presents a tutorial approach to cooperative phenomena in systems far from
        thermal equilibrium and in nonphysical systems. Particular emphasis is placed
        on the question of how order and self-organization may arise. The following
        example is treated among others: the ordered phase of the laser giving rise
        to both coherently oscillating atomic dipole moments and coherent light emission.
        A complete analogy of the laser light distribution function to that of the
        Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity is found mathematically which
        allows us to interpret the laser threshold as a quasi-second-order phase transition
        with soft modes, critical slowing down, etc. Similar phenomena, again closely
        resembling phase transitions, are found in tunnel diodes and in the nonlinear
        wave interaction which occurs, for example, in nonlinear optics. Remarkable
        analogies between the instability of the laser and those in hydro-dynamics
        are elaborated. While these phenomena show pronounced analogies to phase transitions
        in thermal equilibrium, there are further classes of instabilities and new
        phases which rather resemble hard excitations known in electrical engineering.
        Chemical oscillations are particularly important examples. In addition, the
        first part of this article contains the example of the cooperative behavior
        of neuron networks and shows the applicability of simple physical concepts,
        e.g., the Ising model, to the problem of the dynamics of social groups. All
        these above-mentioned examples demonstrate clearly that rather complex phenomena
        brought about by the cooperation of many subsystems can be understood and
        described by a few simple concepts. One of the main concepts is the order
        parameter; another is the adiabatic elimination of the variables of the subsystems,
        which is based upon a hierarchy of time constants present in most systems.
        The second part of this article gives a systematic account of the mathematical
        tools which allow us to deal with fluctuations. It contains the master equation,
        the Fokker-Planck equation, the generalized Fokker-Planck equation, and the
        Langevin equations, and gives several general methods for deriving the stationary
        and, in certain cases, the nonstationary solutions of master equations and
        the Fokker-Planck equations. Such general classes comprise those in which
        detailed balance is present or in which the coupling to the reservoirs is
        weak. In the quantum mechanical domain, the density matrix and the projection
        formalism for its reduction are presented. Finally, it is shown how the principle
        of quantum-classical correspondence allows us to translate quantum statistical
        problems completely into the classical domain.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Haken,

        formation of spacetime singularities is a quite common phenomenon in General
        Relativity and it is regulated by specific theorems. It is widely believed
        that spacetime singularities do not exist in Nature, but that they represent
        a limitation of the classical theory. While we do not yet have any solid theory
        of quantum gravity, toy models of black hole solutions without singularities
        have been proposed. So far, there are only non-rotating regular black holes
        in the literature. These metrics can be hardly tested by astrophysical observations,
        as the black hole spin plays a fundamental role in any astrophysical process.
        In this Letter, we apply the Newman-Janis algorithm to the Hayward and to
        the Bardeen black hole metrics. In both cases, we obtain a family of rotating
        solutions. Every solution corresponds to a different matter configuration.
        Each family has one solution with special properties, which can be written
        in Kerr-like form in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. These special solutions
        are of Petrov type D, they are singularity free, but they violate the weak
        energy condition for a non-vanishing spin and their curvature invariants have
        different values at r=0 depending on the way one approaches the origin. We

        present a detailed analysis of the APW+lo basis set for band-structure calculations.
        This basis set consists of energy independent augmented plane-wave (APW) functions.
        The linearization is introduced through local orbitals evaluated at the same
        linearization energy as the APW functions. It is shown that results obtained
        with the APW+lo basis set converge much faster and often more systematically
        towards the final value. The APW+lo thereby allows accurate treatment of systems
        that were previously unaccessible to linearized APW. Furthermore, it is shown
        that APW+lo converges to the same total energy as LAPW provided the higher
        angular momenta l are linearized, either by adding extra local orbitals or
        treating them by LAPW. It is illustrated that the APW basis functions are
        much closer to the true form of the eigenfunctions than the LAPW basis functions.
        This is especially true for basis functions that have a strong energy dependence

        relations between various treatments of the classical linearly damped harmonic
        oscillator and its quantization are investigated. In the course of a historical
        survey typical features of the problem are discussed on the basis of Havas'
        classical Hamiltonian and the quantum mechanical S\xFCssmann-Hasse-Albrecht
        models as coined by the M\xFCnchen/Garching nuclear physics group. It is shown
        how y imposing a restriction on the classical trajectories in order to connect
        the Hamiltonian with the energy, the time-independent Bateman-Morse-Feshbach-Bopp
        Hamiltonian leads to thetime-dependent Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian. Canonical
        quantization of either formulation entails a violation of Heisenberg's principle.
        By means of a unified treatment of both the electrical and mechanical semi-infinite
        transmission line, this defect is related to the disregard of additional quantum
        fluctuations that are intrinsically connected with the dissipation. The difficulties
        of these models are discussed. Then it is proved that the Bateman dual Hamiltonian
        is connected to a recently developed complex symplectic formulation by a simple
        canonical transformation. The fundamental commutator is still in error. Therefore
        it is demonstrated how, either separating the dual oscillators according to
        a modified version of Bopp's original treatment or reducing classical complex
        phase space by an integration over the mirror image subspace, a quantum continuity

        involved in laser-produced plasma in confined geometry. With this technique,
        a laser irradiates a target at an intensity of a few GW/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, and
        the produced plasma is confined by a transparent overlay to the laser which
        covers this target. This configuration has appeared necessary for example
        for metallurgical applications where, for a given laser energy, enhanced pressures
        must be realized in order to achieve high shock pressures. Therefore, a physical
        study of this method is useful in order to optimize this technique. We have
        first developed an analytical model which describes the different steps involved
        in this process, points out the interest of this technique, and compares it
        to the direct ablation regime. In the first stage, during the laser heating,
        the generated pressure is typically 4-10 times greater than the corresponding
        one obtained in direct ablation. The second step begins after the switch-off
        of the laser and is characterized by an adiabatic cooling of the plasma which
        maintains the applied pressure over a period which is about 2 times the laser-pulse
        duration. Finally, the third stage concerns also the adiabatic cooling of
        the recombined plasma, but during this period the exerted pressure is too
        small to realize a plastic deformation of the material. <P />We show that
        the impulse momentum given to the target is mainly generated during this step.
        This model allows us to also determine the velocities of thin foils accelerated
        with confined plasmas, and we show that very high hydrodynamic efficiencies
        can be achieved by this technique. Experimentally, we measured with quartz
        gauges, the pressures obtained in confined geometry, for 30-, 3-, and 0.6-ns
        laser-pulse duration. This study shows that short pulse durations are sensitive
        to the initial roughness of the interface, and such an effect should be suppressed
        by using a liquid confinement. Then, we conclude that a large fraction of
        the absorbed laser energy (80%-90%) is used for the ionization of the medium
        in these conditions of irradiation. Finally, we experimentally point out that
        the laser-induced breakdown of the confining medium is the main mechanism
        which limits the generated pressure and show the influence of the laser-pulse
        duration on this effect.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Fabbro, R.\",\n          \"Fournier,

        by transfer of angular momentum from light to the material raises the possibility
        of optically driven micromachines. The phenomenon has been observed using
        elliptically polarized laser beams or beams with helical phase structure,.
        But it is difficult to develop high power in such experiments because of overheating
        and unwanted axial forces, limiting the achievable rotation rates to a few
        hertz. This problem can in principle be overcome by using transparent particles,
        transferring angular momentum by a mechanism first observed by Beth in 1936,
        when he reported a tiny torque developed in a quartz `wave-plate' owing to
        the change in polarization of transmitted light. Here we show that an optical
        torque can be induced on microscopic birefringent particles of calcite held
        by optical tweezers. Depending on the polarization of the incident beam, the
        particles either become aligned with the plane of polarization (and thus can
        be rotated through specified angles) or spin with constant rotation frequency.

        a coupling effect of mutual scattering, the Kozai mechanism, and tidal circularization,
        by orbital integrations. Close-in gas giants would have been originally formed
        at several AU beyond the ice lines in protoplanetary disks and migrated close
        to their host stars. Although type II migration due to planet-disk interactions
        may be a major channel for the migration, we show that this scattering process
        would also give a nonnegligible contribution. We carried out orbital integrations
        of three planets with Jupiter mass, directly including the effect of tidal
        circularization. We have found that in about 30% of the runs close-in planets
        are formed, which is much higher than suggested by previous studies. Three-planet
        orbit crossing usually results in the ejection of one or two planets. Tidal
        circularization often occurs during three-planet orbit crossing, but previous
        studies have monitored only the final stage after the ejection, significantly
        underestimating the formation probability. We have found that the Kozai mechanism
        in outer planets is responsible for the formation of close-in planets. During
        three-planet orbital crossing, Kozai excitation is repeated and the eccentricity
        is often increased secularly to values close enough to unity for tidal circularization
        to transform the inner planet to a close-in planet. Since a moderate eccentricity
        can retain for the close-in planet, this mechanism may account for the observed
        close-in planets with moderate eccentricities and without nearby secondary
        planets. Since these planets also remain a broad range of orbital inclinations
        (even retrograde ones), the contribution of this process would be clarified

        some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural
        details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide

        allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger

        a simple model of strong-field ionization of atoms that generalizes the well-known

        structures that correspond to electrons that pass by their parent ion more

        electrical conductivity of solid-state matter is a fundamental physical property
        and can be precisely derived from the resistance measured via the four-point
        probe technique excluding contributions from parasitic contact resistances.
        Over time, this method has become an interdisciplinary characterization tool
        in materials science, semiconductor industries, geology, physics, etc, and
        is employed for both fundamental and application-driven research. However,
        the correct derivation of the conductivity is a demanding task which faces
        several difficulties, e.g. the homogeneity of the sample or the isotropy of
        the phases. In addition, these sample-specific characteristics are intimately
        related to technical constraints such as the probe geometry and size of the
        sample. In particular, the latter is of importance for nanostructures which
        can now be probed technically on very small length scales. On the occasion
        of the 100th anniversary of the four-point probe technique, introduced by
        Frank Wenner, in this review we revisit and discuss various correction factors
        which are mandatory for an accurate derivation of the resistivity from the
        measured resistance. Among others, sample thickness, dimensionality, anisotropy,
        and the relative size and geometry of the sample with respect to the contact
        assembly are considered. We are also able to derive the correction factors
        for 2D anisotropic systems on circular finite areas with variable probe spacings.
        All these aspects are illustrated by state-of-the-art experiments carried
        out using a four-tip STM/SEM system. We are aware that this review article
        can only cover some of the most important topics. Regarding further aspects,
        e.g. technical realizations, the influence of inhomogeneities or different

        effect of tropical cyclone structure on the vortex motion are examined in
        a nondivergent, barotropic numerical model with no basic current. As suggested
        earlier by DeMaria, the initial maximum wind speed has little effect on the
        track. Vortex translation associated with the beta effect depends sensitively
        on the strength of the flow between 300 and 1000 km from the center. If the
        flow in this annulus is made more cyclonic, the track will turn cyclonically
        and move more toward the west in the Northern Hemisphere.The dynamics of this
        beta-drift is studied via a decomposition into symmetric and asymmetric circulations.
        The symmetric flow experiences a slight weakening of the maximum wind speed
        and an anticyclonic circulation is induced beyond 600 km. The asymmetric circulation
        is dominated by an azimuthal wavenumber one circulation with an anticyclonic
        gyre east of the center, a cyclonic gyre to the west and a nearly uniform,
        broad-scale ventilation flow between the gyres. The vortex translation speed
        and direction are almost equal to the averaged of this ventilation flow over
        the area of significant cyclonic circulation in the vortex.Analysis of the
        model streamfunction tendency equation demonstrates that the linear beta term
        is responsible for the initial formation of the asymmetric gyres. Nonlinear
        advection of the asymmetric circulation by the symmetric vortex flow twists
        the interior region between the gyres and orients the ventilation flow toward
        the northwest rather than toward the north. Because this term nearly balances
        the linear beta forcing, the stream-function time tendency (and storm motion)
        is predominantly due to the advection of the symmetric vortex by the ventilation

        rational theory is developed to explain the initial pressure rise and consequent
        separation of a laminar boundary layer when it interacts with a moderately
        strong shock. In this theory, which is firmly based on the linearized theory
        of Lighthill (1953), the region of interest is divided into three parts: the
        major part of the boundary layer, which is shown to change under largely inviscid
        forces, the supersonic main stream just adjacent to the boundary layer in
        which the pressure variation is small; and a region close to the wall, on
        boundary-layer scale, in which the relative variation of the velocity is large
        but is controlled by the incompressible boundary-layer equations, together
        with novel boundary conditions. We find that the first two parts can be handled
        in a straightforward way and the problem of self-induced separation reduces,
        in its essentials, to the solution of a single problem in the theory of incompressible
        boundary layers. It is found that this problem has three solutions, one of
        which corresponds to undisturbed flow and another describes a boundary layer
        which, spontaneously, generates an adverse pressure gradient and a decreasing
        skin friction which eventually vanishes and then downstream a reversed flow
        is set up. The third solution generates a favourable pressure gradient and
        is not relevant to the present study. Although there has hitherto been no
        valid numerical method of integrating a boundary layer with reversed flow,
        we find that an ad hoc method seems to lead to a stable solution which has
        a number of the properties to be expected of a separated boundary layer. Comparison
        with experiment gives qualitatively good agreement, but quantitatively errors
        of the order of 20% are found. It is believed that these errors arise because
        the Reynolds numbers at which the experiments were carried out are too small.\",\n

        due to fluids that migrate upward from deeper levels in the Earth. In mass

        into a rotating tokamak plasma is investigated. In the linear regime, it is
        found that unless the frequency of the imposed perturbation matches closely
        to one of the natural mode frequencies, reconnection at the rational surface
        is suppressed by a large factor. In order to deal with the problem in the
        nonlinear regime a theory of propagating, constant-\u03C8 magnetic islands
        is developed. This theory is valid provided the island width greatly exceeds
        any microscopic scale length (but still remains small compared with the minor
        radius), and the magnetic Reynolds number of the plasma is sufficiently large.
        An island width evolution equation is obtained which, in addition to the usual
        Rutherford term, contains a stabilizing term due ultimately to the inertia
        of the plasma flow pattern set up around the propagating island. A complete
        solution is presented for the case where the island and its associated flow
        pattern are steady. In the nonlinear regime, a fairly sharp threshold is predicted
        for the magnitude of the applied perturbation. Below this threshold, the induced
        islands are rotationally suppressed and partially dragged along by the rotating
        plasma, and above it the islands are virtually fully reconnected and ``locked''
        at the applied frequency of the perturbation. Numerical results from an initial
        value code are presented, which show good agreement with the analytic predictions.
        Finally, it is demonstrated that these theories can be used to interpret data
        recently obtained from the COMPASS-C device [Controlled Fusion and Plasma
        Heating 1990 (EPS, Geneva, 1990), Vol. 1, p. 379]. In particular, a positive

        in March 2007 at the RI Beam Factory (RIBF) at RIKEN Nishina Center, has been
        used to produce a variety of rare-isotope (RI) beams by using in-flight fission
        as well as projectile fragmentation. Its major features are large ion-optical
        acceptances and two-stage structure. Excellent performance in particle identification
        is also an important feature. Efficient RI-beam production based on the in-flight
        scheme has been made possible by these features of the BigRIPS separator,
        allowing us to greatly expand the accessible region of exotic nuclei. An RI-beam
        delivery line following the BigRIPS separator is designed to work as a forward
        spectrometer, called ZeroDegree. As a major experimental device at RIBF, the
        ZeroDegree spectrometer has been used for a variety of reaction studies with

        (RVs), by analysing the multiplanet system Kepler-9. Despite being the first
        system characterized with TTVs, there are several discrepant solutions in
        the literature, with those reporting lower planetary densities being apparently
        in disagreement with high-precision RV observations. To resolve this, we gathered
        HARPS-N RVs at epochs that maximized the difference between the predicted

        the full Kepler data set and performed a dynamical fit, within a Bayesian

        We compared these results with the RV data and found that our solution better

        spectrometer calibration. In the past decade, Kerr frequency comb generators
        have emerged as alternative scheme offering chip-scale integration, high repetition
        rate and bandwidths that are only limited by group velocity dispersion. The
        recent observation of Kerr frequency combs operating in the dissipative Kerr
        soliton (DKS) regime, along with dispersive wave formation, has provided the
        means for fully coherent, broadband Kerr frequency comb generation with engineered
        spectral envelope. Here, by carefully optimizing the photonic Damascene fabrication
        process, and dispersion engineering of $\\\\mathrm{Si_{3}N_{4}}$ microresonators
        with $1\\\\,\\\\mathrm{THz}$ free spectral range, we achieve bandwidths exceeding
        one octave at low powers ($\\\\mathcal{O}(100\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mW})$) for pump
        lasers residing in the telecom C-band ($1.55\\\\,\\\\mathrm{\\\\mu m}$), as
        well as for the first time in the O-band ($1.3\\\\,\\\\mathrm{\\\\mu m}$).
        Equally important, we find that for THz repetition rate comb states, conventional
        criteria applied to identify DKS comb states fail. Investigating the coherence
        of generated, octave-spanning Kerr comb states we unambiguously identify DKS
        states using a response measurement. This allows to demonstrate octave-spanning
        DKS comb states at both pump laser wavelengths of $1.3\\\\mathrm{\\\\,\\\\mu
        m}$ and $1.55\\\\,\\\\mathrm{\\\\mu m}$ including the broadest DKS state generated
        to date, spanning more than $200\\\\,\\\\mathrm{THz}$ of optical bandwidth.
        Octave spanning DKS frequency combs can form essential building blocks for
        metrology or spectroscopy, and their operation at $1.3\\\\mathrm{\\\\,\\\\mu

        imaging, or stellar spectroscopy), there are structured components in this
        noise caused by systematic effects in the astronomical source, the atmosphere,

        physical model for these nuisances is computationally intractable and dependent
        on too many (unknown) parameters to allow rigorous probabilistic inference.
        Sometimes, housekeeping data---and often the science data themselves---can
        be used as predictors of the systematic noise. Linear combinations of simple
        functions of these predictors are often used as computationally tractable

        subtract systematics prior to investigation of the signals of interest, or
        they can be used in a simultaneous fit of the systematics and the signals.
        In this Note, we show that if a Gaussian prior is placed on the weights of

        November-December 1992, we measured microstructure, the hydrographic field,
        and the velocity field in the western equatorial Pacific near 1\xB043'S and
        156\xB0E as the first part of the Tropical Ocean - Global Atmosphere - Coupled
        Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment. During our stay, we observed two westerly
        wind bursts with maximum speeds of about 10 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>, rainfalls of
        about 20 mm h<SUP>-1</SUP>, and nearly 2 weeks of calm and dry weather. During
        wind bursts, mixing in the upper 1 MPa was dramatic and rapid, and the major
        turbulence in the thermocline was produced by near-inertial shears following
        the wind bursts, during which dissipation rates and Richardson numbers were
        comparable to those in the central Pacific. By the end of the October-November
        westerly burst, the averaged eddy diffusivity of momentum in the mixed layer
        was about 10<SUP>-2</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Below the mixed layer,
        a layer about 0.50-0.75 MPa thick with high shear and strain along with a
        high dissipation rate persisted even after the wind burst. During calm days,
        mixing was primarily driven by nighttime convection and was confined to the
        upper 0.1 or 0.2 MPa. In general, no diurnal deep cycle in dissipation rate
        was found below the mixed layer, unlike in the central equatorial Pacific.
        Entrainment below the mixed layer occurred when both wind work and convection
        were large. On average, the entrainment heat flux at the base of the mixed
        layer was about 6 (\xB12) W m<SUP>-2</SUP>. Salinity gradients were important
        to density between 0.3 and 0.6 MPa. However, the salinity stratification did
        not control entrainment mixing. During calm and dry weather, the mixed layer
        heat content was governed by the vertical divergence of the radiative flux,
        that is, the net surface heat flux minus the radiative flux out the bottom
        of the layer. Both the entrainment flux and the advective flux (which was
        estimated as the residual term) were smaller than uncertainties in the surface
        heat flux. During the October-November wind burst, however, the advective
        term was one of the most dominant terms in the heat budget. Although the entrainment
        heat flux was small over short timescales, it may be important in long-term
        budgets because the long-term net surface heating could also be small.\",\n

        by about 50%, and these increases were found not to be very sensitive to model
        parameter values; in the transition zone, however, the predicted change in
        production was smaller and more sensitive to changes in model parameters.
        Increases in higher tropic levels have been observed in subtropical and subarctic
        zones during 1977-1988. This is consistent with model results and the idea
        that the subtropical zone is nutrient-poor, the subartic zone is light-poor,
        and the transition zone is not consistently limited by any one thing. Further,
        our results show changes in mixed layer depths occur on decadal and basin

        monitoring changes in timing of transits of known exoplanets. Nontransiting
        planets in the system can be inferred from TTVs by their gravitational interactions
        with the transiting planet. The TTV method is sensitive to low-mass planets
        that cannot be detected by other means. Inferring the orbital elements and
        mass of the nontransiting planets from TTVs, however, is more challenging

        Here, we extended the new inversion method proposed by Nesvorn\xFD &amp; Morbidelli
        to eccentric transiting planets and inclined orbits. We found that the TTV
        signal can be significantly amplified for hierarchical planetary systems with
        substantial orbital inclinations and/or for an eccentric transiting planet
        with anti-aligned orbit of the planetary companion. Thus, a fortuitous orbital
        setup of an exoplanetary system may significantly enhance our chances of TTV
        detection. We also showed that the detailed shape of the TTV signal is sensitive
        to the orbital inclination of the nontransiting planetary companion. The TTV

        is injected and cooled via Compton scattering of soft photons (produced either
        externally or by the synchrotron mechanism). The scattered photons, constituting
        a primary gamma-ray source, produce electron-positron pairs that act as a
        secondary electron injection, which in turn produce a secondary photon spectrum.
        Pairs formed by a part of the photon spectrum optically thin to pair production
        are taken into account. The distribution of particles and photons is obtained,
        and numerical results as well as analytical solutions to certain special cases
        are presented. For the case of a delta-function primary electron injection
        it is found that the photon spectrum in the X-ray region is well approximated
        by a power law, with the energy spectral index alpha(X) lying in the relatively
        narrow range 0.5-0.9 as the compactness parameter L(x)/R (where L(x) is the
        X-ray luminosity and R is the source radius) varies over many orders of magnitude.

        imagery and in situ ocean data show that the cool anomaly of sea surface temperature
        in the wake of a moving hurricane will disappear over an e-folding time of
        5 to 20 days. We have constructed a very simple, local model of the warming
        process by evaluating the heat budget of the surface layer. This requires
        (1) an estimate of the heat flux anomaly, \u03B4Q, that we presume is associated
        with the cool anomaly of sea surface temperature (SST), \u03B4Q = \u03BB\u03B4T,
        where \u03B4T is the SST anomaly and for nominal trade wind conditions, \u03BB
        = -65 W m<SUP>-2</SUP> C<SUP>-1</SUP>, and (2) the thickness, D, of the surface
        layer that absorbs this heat flux anomaly. Evidence from numerical simulations
        is that D is the trapping depth of the diurnal cycle, and from existing models
        we estimate D = c<SUB>1</SUB>\u03C4/Q<SUB>n</SUB><SUP>1/2</SUP>, where \u03C4
        is the wind stress magnitude, Q<SUB>n</SUB> is the diurnal maximum (noon)
        heat flux and c<SUB>1</SUB> is a product of known physical constants. The
        cool anomaly is then a decaying exponential, \u03B4T \u221D \u03B4T<SUB>0</SUB>exp(-t/\u0393),

        approximately 5 days, and in the wake of Hurricane Frances (2004), very roughly
        20 days. The latter e-folding time was greater (i.e., the normalized warming
        rate was slower) primarily because winds were fresher and secondarily because
        cloud cover was greater. It is notable that the e-folding time in this solution
        depends upon two properties of the surface heat flux, the slowly varying heat

        tight folding and prograde metamorphism, occurred at 1570 \xB1 20 and 1469

        pulsar radio emission is generated in the near magnetosphere of the neutron
        star, and it must propagate through the rest of it to emerge into the interstellar
        medium. An important issue is whether this propagation affects the planes
        of polarization of the generated radiation. Observationally, there is sufficient
        evidence that the emerging radiation is polarized parallel or perpendicular
        to the magnetic field line planes that should be associated with the ordinary

        process. This strongly suggests that the excited X and O modes are not affected

        vectors. In this paper, we demonstrate that the conditions for adiabatic walking
        are not fulfilled within the soliton model of pulsar radio emission, in which
        the coherent curvature radiation occurs at frequencies much lower than the

        and objective review of the work done over the last decade to identify the
        challenges and future opportunities in the area of functional nanocomposites.
        Increasing interest in lightweight materials has resulted in studies on hollow

        manipulate perpendicular magnetization of a ferromagnetic layer using spin-orbit
        torque (SOT) without field. We report that a commonly used antiferromagnetic
        material IrMn can be a promising candidate as a functional layer to realize
        field-free magnetization switching driven by SOT in which IrMn is employed

        is used to study the dynamics and thermodynamics of the Arabian Sea mini warm
        pool (ASMWP), the warmest region in the northern Indian Ocean during January-April.
        The model simulates the seasonal cycle of temperature, salinity and currents
        as well as the winter time temperature inversions in the southeastern Arabian
        Sea (SEAS) quite realistically with climatological forcing. An experiment
        which maintained uniform salinity of 35 psu over the entire model domain reproduces
        the ASMWP similar to the control run with realistic salinity and this is contrary
        to the existing theories that stratification caused by the intrusion of low-salinity
        water from the Bay of Bengal into the SEAS is crucial for the formation of
        ASMWP. The contribution from temperature inversions to the warming of the
        SEAS is found to be negligible. Experiments with modified atmospheric forcing
        over the SEAS show that the low latent heat loss over the SEAS compared to
        the surroundings, resulting from the low winds due to the orographic effect
        of Western Ghats, plays an important role in setting up the sea surface temperature
        (SST) distribution over the SEAS during November-March. During March-May,
        the SEAS responds quickly to the air-sea fluxes and the peak SST during April-May
        is independent of the SST evolution during previous months. The SEAS behaves
        as a low wind, heat-dominated regime during November-May and, therefore, the

        per year, distributed globally via the LCG, OSG and NDGF computing grids,
        now commonly known as the WLCG. Since its inception in 2005 DQ2 has continuously

        over 3000 scientists participating from more than 150 universities and laboratories
        in 34 countries. Fulfilling its primary requirement of providing a highly

        comparative study of X- and O-mode high field side launch for electron cyclotron
        heating (ECH) breakdown and startup of tokamak plasmas has been performed.
        It is found that X-mode power is not absorbed at the cyclotron resonance but
        uniquely at the upper hybrid resonance, displaced to the low field side of
        the cyclotron resonance. O-mode power, however, is absorbed at the cyclotron
        resonance as well. The displacement of the upper hybrid resonance to the low
        field side with O-mode launch is significantly smaller than that with X-mode
        launch because of the lower densities produced by O-mode launch at the same
        microwave power level. The result is a more central and less localized breakdown
        with O-mode launch. The breakdown characteristics of X- and O-mode launch
        are seen to affect the position of the initial plasma current centroid in
        the poloidal cross-section. There is a strong correlation between the initial
        current ramp rate and the initial plasma current position which is most likely
        due to the dependence of the plasma inductance, toroidal electric field and
        field line connection lengths on the plasma major radius. O-mode launch starts
        the plasma more centrally than X-mode launch and results in higher current
        ramp rates. X-mode startup occurs further to the low field side where current
        ramp rates are observed to be poor\",\n        \"author\":[\"Whaley, D. R.\",\n

        fiber arrays, and birefringent fibers. By taking the 3-CNLS equations as an
        example for the N-CNLS ones (N\u2A7E3), we derive the analytic mixed-type
        two- and three-soliton solutions in more general forms than those obtained
        in the previous studies with the Hirota method and symbolic computation. With
        the choice of parameters for those soliton solutions, soliton interactions
        and complexes are investigated through the asymptotic and graphic analysis.
        Soliton interactions and complexes with the bound dark solitons in a mode
        or two modes are observed, including that (i) the two bright solitons display
        the breatherlike structures while the two dark ones stay parallel, (ii) the
        two bright and dark solitons all stay parallel, and (iii) the states of the
        bound solitons change from the breatherlike structures to the parallel one
        even with the distance between those solitons smaller than that before the
        interaction with the regular one soliton. Asymptotic analysis is also used
        to investigate the elastic and inelastic interactions between the bound solitons

        work by Zellers et al. (2018) introduced a new task of commonsense natural
        language inference: given an event description such as \\\"A woman sits at
        a piano,\\\" a machine must select the most likely followup: \\\"She sets
        her fingers on the keys.\\\" With the introduction of BERT, near human-level
        performance was reached. Does this mean that machines can perform human level
        commonsense inference? In this paper, we show that commonsense inference still
        proves difficult for even state-of-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag,
        a new challenge dataset. Though its questions are trivial for humans (&gt;95%

        Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a series of

        wrong answers. AF proves to be surprisingly robust. The key insight is to
        scale up the length and complexity of the dataset examples towards a critical

        with lysozyme (LSZ) are investigated. In solution LSZ is moderately positively
        and PAHA negatively charged at the investigated pH values. The proton binding
        of PAHA and of LSZ is determined by potentiometric proton titrations at various
        KCl concentrations. It is also measured for two mixtures of PAHA-LSZ and compared
        with theoretically calculated proton binding assuming no mutual interaction.
        The charge adaptation due to PAHA-LSZ interaction is relatively small and
        only significant at low and high pH. Next to the proton binding, the mass
        ratio PAHA/LSZ at the iso-electric point (IEP) of the complex at given solution
        conditions is measured together with the pH using the M\xFCtek particle charge
        detector. From the pH changes the charge adaptation due to the interaction
        can be found. Also these measurements show that the net charge adaptation
        is weak for PAHA-LSZ complexes at their IEP. PAHA/LSZ mass ratios in the complexes
        at the IEP are measured at pH 5 and 7. At pH 5 and 50 mmol/L KCl the charge
        of the complex is compensated for 30-40% by K <SUP>+</SUP>; at pH 7, where
        LSZ has a rather low positive charge, this is 45-55%. At pH 5 and 5 mmol/L
        KCl the PAHA/LSZ mass ratio at the IEP of the complex depends on the order
        of addition. When LSZ is added to PAHA about 25% K <SUP>+</SUP> is included
        in the complex, but no K <SUP>+</SUP> is incorporated when PAHA is added to

        addition to PAHA slow precipitation occurs (6-24 h) in the IEP, but after
        addition of PAHA to LSZ no precipitation can be seen after 12 h. Clearly,
        PAHA/LSZ complexation and the colloidal stability of PAHA-LSZ aggregates depend
        on the order of addition. Some implications of the observed behavior are discussed.\",\n

        asymmetric multilayers have been used to efficiently manipulate magnetization.
        In a structure with vertical symmetry breaking, a damping-like SOT can deterministically
        switch a perpendicular magnet, provided an in-plane magnetic field is applied.
        Recently, it has been further demonstrated that the in-plane magnetic field
        can be eliminated by introducing a new type of perpendicular field-like SOT
        via incorporating a lateral structural asymmetry into the device. Typically,
        however, when a current is applied to such devices with combined vertical
        and lateral asymmetries, both the perpendicular field-like torque and the
        damping-like torque coexist, hence jointly affecting the magnetization switching
        behavior. Here, we study perpendicular magnetization switching driven by the
        combination of the perpendicular field-like and the damping-like SOTs, which
        exhibits deterministic switching mediated through domain wall propagation.
        It is demonstrated that the role of the damping-like SOT in the deterministic
        switching is highly dependent on the magnetization direction in the domain
        wall. By contrast, the perpendicular field-like SOT is solely determined by
        the relative orientation between the lateral structural asymmetry and the
        current direction, regardless of the magnetization direction in the domain
        wall. The experimental results further the understanding of SOTs-induced switching,
        with implications for spintronic devices.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Yu, Guoqiang\",\n

        The effects of In-doping on the properties of CdZnTe single crystals have
        been analyzed in detail. Leakage current-bias voltage ( I- V) measurement
        shows that the resistivity of CdZnTe increases three orders after In is introduced

        by In. The leakage current in CdZnTe:In is stabilized more quickly compared
        with that in CdZnTe, revealed by leakage current-time ( I- t) measurement.
        IR transmission spectra of both ingots indicate that In-doping results in
        remarkable reduction of the IR transmission of CdZnTe crystals. Photoluminescence
        (PL) measurement shows that a new deep-level emission appears, due to an In-related

        temperature (T<SUB>c</SUB>) of Pt/Co/Pt thin films on the thicknesses of Pt
        seed (Pt<SUB>s</SUB>) and presence of Ta buffer layer has been investigated
        in this work. Pt and Co thicknesses were varied between 2 to 8 nm and 0.35
        to 1.31 nm (across the spin reorientation transition thickness) respectively
        and the T<SUB>c</SUB> was measured using SQUID magnetometer. We have observed
        a systematic dependence of T<SUB>c</SUB> on the thickness of Pt<SUB>s</SUB>.
        For 8nm thickness of Pt<SUB>s</SUB> the Co layer of 0.35nm showed ferromagnetism
        with perpendicular anisotropy at room temperature. As the thickness of the
        Pt<SUB>s</SUB> was decreased to 2nm, the T<SUB>c</SUB> went down below 250K.
        XRD data indicated polycrystalline growth of Pt<SUB>s</SUB> on SiO<SUB>2</SUB>.
        On the contrary Ta buffer layer promoted the growth of Pt(111). As a consequence
        Ta(5nm)/Pt(3nm)/Co(0.35nm)/Pt(2nm) had much higher T<SUB>c</SUB> (above 300K)
        with perpendicular anisotropy when compared to the same stack without the

        consider the total nonlocal energy associated with a particle at rest in the
        Hubble flow, i.e., the relational energy between this particle and all connected
        particles within the causal horizon. The particle, even while at rest, partakes
        in relative recessional and peculiar motion of connected particles in three
        dimensions. A geometrical argument due to Berkeley suggests that the nonlocal

        are equal, and match Misner-Sharp energy within the apparent horizon. Contributions

        classification has been a topic of intense study in machine learning, and
        several algorithms have been proposed towards this important task. However,
        in a recent study, Friedler et al. observed that fair classification algorithms
        may not be stable with respect to variations in the training dataset -- a
        crucial consideration in several real-world applications. Motivated by their
        work, we study the problem of designing classification algorithms that are
        both fair and stable. We propose an extended framework based on fair classification
        algorithms that are formulated as optimization problems, by introducing a
        stability-focused regularization term. Theoretically, we prove a stability
        guarantee, that was lacking in fair classification algorithms, and also provide
        an accuracy guarantee for our extended framework. Our accuracy guarantee can
        be used to inform the selection of the regularization parameter in our framework.
        To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that combines stability
        and fairness in automated decision-making tasks. We assess the benefits of
        our approach empirically by extending several fair classification algorithms

        by the need to assess the probability of fatality when conducting field work,
        we have worked closely with the New Zealand volcano monitoring team to explore
        the potential utility of BNs. We adapted a previously published BN for a pilot
        study to forecast volcanic eruption on Whakaari/White Island. Developing the
        model structure provided a useful framework for the members of the volcano
        monitoring team to share their knowledge and interpretation of the volcanic
        system. We aimed to capture the conceptual understanding of the volcanic processes
        and represent all observables that are regularly monitored. The pilot model
        has a total of 30 variables, four of them describing the volcanic processes
        that can lead to three different types of eruptions: phreatic, magmatic explosive
        and magmatic effusive. The remaining 23 variables are grouped into observations
        related to seismicity, fluid geochemistry and surface manifestations. To estimate
        the model parameters, we held a workshop with eleven experts, including two
        from outside the monitoring team. To reduce the number of conditional probabilities
        that the experts needed to estimate, each variable is described by only two
        states. However, experts were concerned about this limitation, in particular
        for continuous data. Therefore, they were reluctant to define thresholds to
        distinguish between states. We conclude that volcano monitoring requires BN
        modeling techniques that can accommodate continuous variables. More work is
        required to link unobservable (latent) processes with observables and with
        eruptive patterns, and to model dynamic processes. A provisional application
        of the pilot model revealed several key insights. Refining the BN modeling
        techniques will help advance understanding of volcanoes and improve capabilities
        for forecasting volcanic eruptions. We consider that BNs will become essential
        for handling ever-burgeoning observations, and for assessing data\u2019s evidential
        meaning for operational eruption forecasting.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Christophersen,

        methods. Our results show that contrary to common belief, types of hydrogenation
        configurations of graphene (the aggregated all-paired configurations) can
        satisfy the thermodynamic requirement for room-temperature hydrogen storage.
        However, the peculiarity of the paired adsorption modes gives rise to a large
        kinetic barrier against hydrogen migration and desorption. It means that an
        extremely high pressure is required to induce the migration-derived hydrogenation.
        However, if mobile catalytic particles are present inside the graphitic interstitials,
        hydrogen migration channels can open and the spillover phenomena can be realized.
        We suggest a molecular model for such a mobile catalyst which can exchange
        hydrogen atoms with the wall of graphene.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Han, Sang

        general model of a hybrid interfacial domain wall (HIDW) in ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic
        exchange biased bilayers is proposed, where an interfacial domain wall is
        allowed to extend into either the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic layer
        or across both. The proposition is based on our theoretical investigation
        on thickness and field dependences of ferromagnetic domain wall (FMDW) and
        antiferromagnetic domain wall (AFDW), respectively. Good match of the simulation
        to the hysteresis loops of a series of NiFe/FeMn exchange-biased bilayers
        confirms the existence of the HIDW, where the AFDW part is found to preferentially
        occupy the entire antiferromagnetic layer while the FMDW shrinks with the
        increased magnetic field as expected. The observed asymmetry between the ascending

        online platforms today can be thought of as two-sided markets with producers
        and customers of goods and services. There have been concerns that over-emphasis
        on customer satisfaction by the platforms may affect the well-being of the
        producers. To counter such issues, few recent works have attempted to incorporate
        fairness for the producers. However, these studies have overlooked an important
        issue in such platforms -- to supposedly improve customer utility, the underlying
        algorithms are frequently updated, causing abrupt changes in the exposure
        of producers. In this work, we focus on the fairness issues arising out of
        such frequent updates, and argue for incremental updates of the platform algorithms
        so that the producers have enough time to adjust (both logistically and mentally)
        to the change. However, naive incremental updates may become unfair to the
        customers. Thus focusing on recommendations deployed on two-sided platforms,
        we formulate an ILP based online optimization to deploy changes incrementally
        in n steps, where we can ensure smooth transition of the exposure of items
        while guaranteeing a minimum utility for every customer. Evaluations over
        multiple real world datasets show that our proposed mechanism for platform

        Our results show that the presence of few-layer graphene allows the optical
        emission of glass to be observed at lower irradiance than conventional LIBS.
        This effect is discussed in the frame of the absorption of the laser pulse
        by the graphene and the heat transfer to the beneath the sample. It is reported
        that the LIBS intensity increases with the number of graphene layers when
        it ranges from 6 to 15 layers. The surface of the sample after LIBS revealed
        that the graphene was almost completely removed after one pulse without causing
        apparent visible damage to the sample. The proposed method to improve LIBS

        for forward simulation and inverse design of nanophotonic structures. Deep
        learning technology greatly reduces the time of optical simulation and enables

        BP is very sensitive to the initial values and hard to converge to the optimal

        paper aims to apply a recently developed numerical scheme toward multi-time
        scale modeling, which we refer to as \u2018Practical Time Averaging' (PTA),
        to molecular dynamical (MD) systems. In the first part, we investigate the
        fine-scale dynamics of a one-dimensional chain of identical particles under
        cyclic loading. Assuming a double-well interatomic potential among adjacent
        particles leads to a phase transition between two distinct equilibrium states.
        Specifically, we study the macroscopic stress-strain behavior of the dynamical
        chain in three settings, i.e. Newtonian MD, Newtonian MD with viscous dissipation
        and Newtonian MD with thermostat. Rate-independent high frequency oscillations
        are observed in Newtonian MD due to an instability that is related to the
        non-convexity of the strain energy. This is stabilized by adding viscosity
        or a thermostat, which leads to strong hysteresis that is consistent with
        quasi-static results (i.e. lattice statics). In the second part, we first
        define coarse variables as finite time averages of phase functions in MD.
        Then we apply the technique of PTA developed in Tan et al. (2013) to numerically
        approximate the coarse dynamics for the time averaged quantities. The tested
        model problems include a two-dimensional lattice made of stoichiometric Nickel-Manganese
        undergoing detwinning and a three-dimensional atomic chain made of face-centered
        cubic (FCC) Nickel under uniaxial tension. The macroscopic features (such
        as space-time averaged strain/stress) are obtained from coarse dynamics. It
        is also shown that the time savings become significant when the loading rate

        physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics.
        Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open
        source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications
        in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution
        module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations
        of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass
        to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves
        the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses
        adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports
        shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide
        equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data,
        and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate
        Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate
        independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive
        verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the
        wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary
        tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very
        old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M <SUB>sun</SUB> star from
        the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed
        profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning
        phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase;
        the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the
        complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of
        core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and
        the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star. MESA can be downloaded

        discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel
        TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method,
        and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation
        of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation,
        while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces
        are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally
        be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces
        are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined
        with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme
        where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps.
        Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain
        decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling
        curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend
        on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption
        and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first
        cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10<SUP>10</SUP> dark matter
        particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10<SUP>5</SUP>
        per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out
        very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling
        and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million.
        We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and

        been modelled numerically either by direct integration, in which the computation
        needed increases as N<SUP>2</SUP>, or by an iterative potential method in
        which the number of operations grows as N log N. Here we describe a novel
        method of directly calculating the force on N bodies that grows only as N
        log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space
        into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells
        whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree
        is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages
        over potential-solving codes are: accurate local interactions; freedom from
        geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class
        of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic and cosmological
        ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity
        and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate

        a parallel version that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers

        of low mass stars from the main sequence to the helium flash. Many such computations
        are handicapped by the fact that the hydrogen burning shell source becomes
        very thin at a relatively early stage of evolution, and this means that either
        a very short time step is needed on the red giant branch, or else that some
        special method must be introduced. The present method has neither handicap:
        the same procedure is used whether there is a thin shell or not, and the time
        step can be chosen so that the overall structure of the star changes by a
        fixed small amount per step. About 100 or 150 steps are necessary to evolve
        a star to the helium flash. The basic features of the method are that the
        structure equations are solved using a non-Lagrangian mesh, so that a thin
        shell if it exists can move slowly through the mesh, even if it moves rapidly
        with respect to the mass coordinate; and that the composition and the mesh
        are solved simultaneously with the structure equations, giving greater stability
        and self-consistency. Although the work described here does not take account
        of convective mixing of composition, it is suggested that a simple generalization

        Here we report two additional transiting circumbinary planets: Kepler-34 (AB)b
        and Kepler-35 (AB)b, referred to here as Kepler-34 b and Kepler-35 b, respectively.

        an H II region whose expansion dissipates the residual gas in the protocluster

        stellar collisions involving the same object can occur. It has been suggested
        that this leads to the formation of an intermediate-mass black hole. To verify
        this scenario we compute the detailed evolution of the merger remnant of three
        sequences, then follow the evolution until the onset of carbon burning, and
        estimate the final remnant mass to determine the ultimate fate of a runaway
        merger sequence. We use a detailed stellar evolution code to follow the evolution
        of the collision product. At each collision we mix the two colliding stars,
        accounting for the mass loss during the collision. During the stellar evolution
        we apply mass-loss rates from the literature, as appropriate for the evolutionary
        stage of the merger remnant. We computed models for high (Z = 0.02) and low
        (Z = 0.001) metallicity to quantify metallicity effects. We find that the
        merger remnant becomes a Wolf-Rayet star before the end of core hydrogen burning.
        Mass loss from stellar winds dominates the mass increase due to repeated mergers
        for all three merger sequences that we consider. In none of our high-metallicity
        models an intermediate-mass black hole is formed, instead our models have
        a mass of 10-14 {M}_\u2299 at the onset of carbon burning. For low metallicity
        the final remnant is more massive and may explode as a pair-creation supernova.
        We find that our metal-rich models become inflated as a result of developing
        an extended low-density envelope. This may increase the probability of further
        collisions, but self-consistent N-body calculations with detailed evolution

        Over the years, the N<SUP>2</SUP> nature of the direct force calculation has
        proved a barrier for extending the particle number. Following an early introduction
        of force polynomials and individual time steps, the calculation cost was first
        reduced by the introduction of a neighbour scheme. After a decade of GRAPE
        computers which speeded up the force calculation further, we are now in the
        era of GPUs where relatively small hardware systems are highly cost effective.
        A significant gain in efficiency is achieved by employing the GPU to obtain
        the so-called regular force which typically involves some 99 per cent of the
        particles, while the remaining local forces are evaluated on the host. However,
        the latter operation is performed up to 20 times more frequently and may still
        account for a significant cost. This effort is reduced by parallel SSE/AVX
        procedures where each interaction term is calculated using mainly single precision.
        We also discuss further strategies connected with coordinate and velocity
        prediction required by the integration scheme. This leaves hard binaries and
        multiple close encounters which are treated by several regularization methods.

        is specified by a phase-space distribution function which, in turn, depends
        on the integrals of motion. Bayesian statistics and the Markov chain Monte
        Carlo method are used to tailor the model to satisfy observational data and
        theoretical constraints. By way of example, we construct a chain of 10<SUP>5</SUP>

        while heating of the gas is provided by the far-ultraviolet flux of all stars.
        Stars are allowed to form from the gas according to a Jeans instability criterion:
        gas is unstable when the Jeans mass is smaller than a critical mass, and stars
        form as soon as the gas remains unstable longer than the collapse time. With
        these ingredients we are able to create a two-phase interstellar medium and
        our model gives realistic star formation rates (SFRs). We investigate the
        influence of free parameters on the star formation. In order of decreasing
        importance these are: ionization fraction of the gas (determines the cooling
        properties), initial mass function (controls the heat input for the gas),
        collapse time for molecular clouds, and star formation efficiency. In the
        simulations the star formation quickly settles a kind of thermal equilibrium
        of the ISM. This result strongly favours the self-regulating mechanism for
        star formation. The model yields a Schmidt law power dependence of the SFR
        on gas density (SFR{prop.to}\u03C1^n^) with index n=~1.3, in good agreement
        with observations. The simulations show that star formation can only occur
        in the mid-plane of the galaxy, where the gas is dense enough to cool below
        100K. The gas above the plane and outside approximately 6 radial scale lengths
        is always warm (T&gt;8000K), heated by the stellar photons. It suggests that
        radial truncation of stellar disks is a thermal rather than a dynamical process.
        Flocculent spiral structure is generally found in the cold gas and consequently
        also in the young stellar population. It suggests that flocculent spirals
        are due to the dissipational nature of gas.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Gerritsen,

        that are able to follow gas dynamics and radiative transfer (RT) self-consistently
        is key to the solution of many problems in numerical astrophysics. Such fluid
        flows are highly complex, rarely allowing even for approximate analytical
        solutions against which numerical codes can be tested. An alternative validation
        procedure is to compare different methods against each other on common problems,

        validity for the methods. Previously, we presented such a comparison for a
        set of pure RT tests (i.e. for fixed, non-evolving density fields). This is
        the second paper of the Cosmological Radiative Transfer Comparison Project,
        in which we compare nine independent RT codes directly coupled to gas dynamics
        on three relatively simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems: (i) the expansion
        of an HII region in a uniform medium, (ii) an ionization front in a 1/r<SUP>2</SUP>
        density profile with a flat core and (iii) the photoevaporation of a uniform

        and no big failures, indicating that the participating codes have reached

        differ, and virtually every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed,
        in one respect or another, with the majority of the results. This underscores

        The gravity of the stars and the surrounding gas are coupled self-consistently
        to allow the realistic dynamical evolution of the cluster. While the equations
        of motion are solved, a stellar evolution code keeps track of the changes

        and supernovae deposits mass and energy into the gas reservoir in which the
        cluster is embedded. We examine cluster models with 1000 stars, but we varied
        the star formation efficiency (between 0.05 and 0.5), cluster radius (0.1-1.0
        pc), the degree of virial support of the initial population of stars (0-100

        Survival is more likely if gas is not blown out violently by a supernova and

        Simulating a stellar collision event can be an intensive numerical task, as
        detailed calculations of this process require hydrodynamic simulations in
        three dimensions. We present a computationally inexpensive method in which
        we approximate the merger process, including shock heating, hydrodynamic mixing

        We find that without the effects of microscopic mixing, the temperature and
        chemical composition profiles in a collision product can become double-valued
        functions of enclosed mass. Such an unphysical situation is mended by simulating

        by an ordinary G dwarf star in an unusually wide (P <SUB>orb</SUB> ~= 95.2
        days) and eccentric (e ~= 0.44) orbit. The standard model for producing MSPs
        fails to explain the orbital characteristics of this extraordinary binary,
        and alternative binary models are unable to explain the observables. We present
        a triple-star model for producing MSPs in relatively wide eccentric binaries
        with a normal (main-sequence) stellar companion. We start from a stable triple
        system consisting of a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) with an orbital period
        of at least 1 day, accompanied by a G dwarf in a wide and possibly eccentric
        orbit. Variations in the initial conditions naturally provide a satisfactory
        explanation for the unexplained triple component in the eclipsing soft X-ray
        transient 4U 2129+47 or the cataclysmic variable EC 19314-5915. The best explanation
        for J1903+0327, however, results from the expansion of the orbit of the LMXB,
        driven by the mass transfer from the evolving donor star to its neutron star
        companion, which causes the triple eventually to become dynamically unstable.
        Using numerical computations we show that, depending on the precise system
        configuration at the moment the triple becomes dynamically unstable, the ejection
        of each of the three components is possible. If the donor star of the LMXB
        is ejected, a system resembling J1903+0327 will result. If the neutron star
        is ejected, a single MSP results. This model therefore also provides a straightforward
        mechanism for forming a single MSP in the Galactic disk. We conclude that
        the Galaxy contains some 30-300 binaries with characteristics similar to J1903+0327

        reduces the merging timescale of the binary through the gravitational radiation

        This discrepancy leaves the high eccentricity of the SMBH binaries in N-body

        centers have revealed that significant fractions of the dense circumnuclear
        gas have high kinetic temperatures, which are hard to explain by pure photon
        excitation, but may be caused by dissipation of turbulent energy. <BR /> Aims:
        We aim to determine to what extent mechanical heating should be taken into
        account while modeling PDRs. To this end, the effect of dissipated turbulence
        on the thermal and chemical properties of PDRs is explored. <BR /> Methods:
        Clouds are modeled as 1D semi-infinite slabs whose thermal and chemical equilibrium
        is solved for using the Leiden PDR-XDR code, where mechanical heating is added
        as a constant term throughout the cloud. An extensive parameter space in hydrogen
        gas density, FUV radiation field and mechanical heating rate is considered,
        covering almost all possible cases for the ISM relevant to the conditions
        that are encountered in galaxies. Effects of mechanical heating on the temperature
        profiles, column densities of CO and H<SUB>2</SUB>O and column density ratios
        of HNC, HCN and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> are discussed. <BR /> Results: In a steady-state
        treatment, mechanical heating seems to play an important role in determining
        the kinetic temperature of the gas in molecular clouds. Particularly in high-energy
        environments such as starburst galaxies and galaxy centers, model gas temperatures
        are underestimated by at least a factor of two if mechanical heating is ignored.
        The models also show that CO, HCN and H<SUB>2</SUB>O column densities increase
        as a function of mechanical heating. The HNC/HCN integrated column density
        ratio shows a decrease by a factor of at least two in high density regions
        with n ~ 10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, whereas that of HCN/HCO<SUP>+</SUP>
        shows a strong dependence on mechanical heating for this same density range,
        with boosts of up to three orders of magnitude. <BR /> Conclusions: The effects
        of mechanical heating cannot be ignored in studies of the molecular gas excitation
        whenever the ratio of the star formation rate to the gas density (SFR/n<SUP>3/2</SUP>)
        is close to, or exceeds, 7 \xD7 10<SUP>-6</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>
        cm<SUP>4.5</SUP>. If mechanical heating is not included, predicted column
        densities (such as those of CO) are underestimated, sometimes (as in the case
        of HCN and HCO<SUP>+</SUP>) even by a few orders of magnitude. As a lower
        bound to its importance, we determined that it has non-negligible effects
        already when mechanical heating is as little as 1% of the UV heating in a
        PDR. <P />Appendix A is available in electronic form at <A href=\\\"http://www.aanda.org\\\">http://www.aanda.org</A>\",\n

        We present an improved version of the SimpleX method for radiative transfer
        on an unstructured Delaunay grid. The grid samples the medium through which
        photons are transported in an optimal way for fast radiative transfer calculations.
        <BR /> Aims: We study the detailed working of SimpleX in test problems and
        show improvements over the previous version of the method. <BR /> Methods:
        We have applied a direction conserving transport scheme that correctly transports
        photons in the optically thin regime, a regime where the original SimpleX
        algorithm lost its accuracy. In addition, a scheme of dynamic grid updates
        is employed to ensure correct photon transport when the optical depth changes
        during a simulation. For the application to large data sets, the method is
        parallellised for distributed memory machines using MPI. <BR /> Results: To
        test the new method, we have performed standard tests for cosmological radiative
        transfer. We show excellent correspondence with both the analytical solution
        (when available) and to the results of other codes compared to the former

        This technique reduces by a substantial factor the computer run time needed
        in order to resolve a given scale as compared to single-mass models. It therefore
        allows to resolve smaller scales in N-body simulations for a given computer
        run time. Here, we present several models with an effective resolution of
        up to 1.68 \xD7 10<SUP>9</SUP> particles within their virial radius which
        are stable over cosmologically relevant time-scales. As an application, we
        confirm the theoretical prediction by Dehnen that in mergers of collisionless
        structures like dark matter haloes always the cusp of the steepest progenitor
        is preserved. We model each merger progenitor with an effective number of
        particles of approximately 10<SUP>8</SUP> particles. We also find that in
        a core-core merger the central density approximately doubles whereas in the
        cusp-cusp case the central density only increases by approximately 50 per

        Starting with a photometric catalog of the cluster, we employ a maximum likelihood
        technique to determine the mass distribution of its members, including single
        stars and both components of binary systems. We find that the overall binary
        fraction for unresolved pairs is 68%. Extrapolating to include resolved systems,
        this fraction climbs to about 76%, significantly higher than the accepted
        field star result. Both figures are sensitive to the cluster age, for which
        we have used the currently favored value of 125 Myr. The primary and secondary
        masses within binaries are correlated, in the sense that their ratios are
        closer to unity than under the hypothesis of random pairing. We map out the
        spatial variation of the cluster's projected and three-dimensional mass and

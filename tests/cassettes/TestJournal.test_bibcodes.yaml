        astrophysics is a new and quickly growing discipline. In this book the authors
        outline the fundamentals for computational astrophysics, focusing on the use

        general-purpose simulation environment in astrophysics written in Python.
        AMUSE allows you to combine existing solvers to build new applications that
        can be combined again to study gradually more complex situations. This enables
        the growth of multi-physics and multi-scale application software in a hierarchical
        fashion, testing each intermediate step as the complexity of the software
        continues to increase. All examples in the book are associated with codes

        low magnetic field neutron stars which accrete for long times from a surrounding

        such stars could become isolated or binary pulsars, depending on whether their
        companions have subsequently disrupted the binary by either their tidal break
        ups or their supernova explosions. Such pulsars constitute a new class, with

        4+7 orders of magnitude less than the expected number of neutron stars and
        black holes in binary systems. It is shown in the paper that the main condition
        for the appearance of X-ray source in a binary system including relativistic
        star is that the size of the normal component must be close to size of its
        critical Roche lobe. In the case of accretion of the stellar wind matter in
        detached binary system the specific angular momentum of the matter captured
        by the relativistic star is small. Therefore the accreting disk is not formed
        around relativistic star. Consequently, a black hole in detached binary system
        can not be strong X-ray source (no matter how strong the stellar wind might
        be). In this case the accretion is spherically-symmetric and black hole is
        the source of hard X-ray and y-ray radiation. Young neutron star in detached
        system is ejecting pulsar, radiating in X-ray spectral band, like the Crab
        pulsar. Its radioemission is absorbed in stellar wind plasma due to free-free
        processes. Deceleration of the pulsar rotation and connected decrease of its
        luminosity makes possible the penetration of the ambient plasma inside light
        cylinder. This may lead to the switching off of the pulsar mechanism. However
        rapidly rotating magnetosphere of the neutron star throws away the falling
        matter, preventing the accretion. The rotation, consequently, continues to
        decelerate. Only after sufficient deceleration of neutron star rotation the
        accretion becomes possible and neutron star will be the X-ray source. However
        the estimates show that the deceleration time up to this stage exceeds the
        evolutionary time of the normal component. Only in the extremely close binaries
        having anomalously strong accreting matter flow it is possible for the magnetized
        neutron star to convert into the X-ray sources. For the same reason old single
        pulsars with strong magnetic field never become the sources of ultra-violet
        and soft X-ray radiation. Key words: black holes and neutron stars accretion

        not (even asymptotically) adhere to their nominal \u03C7<SUP>2</SUP> and F-distributions
        in many statistical tests common in astrophysics, thereby casting many marginal
        line or source detections and nondetections into doubt. Although the above
        authors illustrate the many legitimate uses of these statistics, in some important
        cases it can be impossible to compute the correct false positive rate. For
        example, it has become common practice to use the LRT or the F-test to detect
        a line in a spectral model or a source above background despite the lack of
        certain required regularity conditions. (These applications were not originally
        suggested by Cash or by Bevington.) In these and other settings that involve
        testing a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space, contrary
        to common practice, the nominal \u03C7<SUP>2</SUP> distribution for the LRT
        or the F-distribution for the F-test should not be used. In this paper, we
        characterize an important class of problems in which the LRT and the F-test
        fail and illustrate this nonstandard behavior. We briefly sketch several possible
        acceptable alternatives, focusing on Bayesian posterior predictive probability
        values. We present this method in some detail since it is a simple, robust,
        and intuitive approach. This alternative method is illustrated using the gamma-ray
        burst of 1997 May 8 (GRB 970508) to investigate the presence of an Fe K emission
        line during the initial phase of the observation. There are many legitimate
        uses of the LRT and the F-test in astrophysics, and even when these tests
        are inappropriate, there remain several statistical alternatives (e.g., judicious
        use of error bars and Bayes factors). Nevertheless, there are numerous cases

        radio pulsars are neutron stars with magnetic fields of ~10<SUP>12</SUP> gauss

        pulsars have much weaker fields (~10<SUP>9</SUP> gauss) and faster, millisecond
        spin rates. For both types of pulsar, the energy driving the radio pulsations
        is thought to be derived from the rotation of the neutron star. The star gradually
        `spins down' as energy is radiated away. Millisecond radio pulsars are often
        located in binary systems. In a widely accepted theoretical model,, they started
        as ordinary pulsars which lost most of their magnetic field and were `spun

        systems can accrete matter and angular momentum from the companion star and
        be spun-up to millisecond rotational periods. During the accretion stage,
        the system is called a low-mass X-ray binary, and bright X-ray emission is
        observed. When the rate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary
        stages, these binaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered
        by the neutron star's rotating magnetic field. This evolutionary model is
        supported by the detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting
        neutron stars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered
        millisecond pulsar. It has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may
        temporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.
        Only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. Here
        we report observations of accretion-powered, millisecond X-ray pulsations
        from a neutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. Within
        a few days after a month-long X-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected.

        star is proposed which includes a detailed description of matter flow in the
        transition region between the disk and the magnetosphere. It is shown that
        the disk plasma cannot be completely screened from the stellar magnetic field
        and that the resulting magnetic coupling between the star and the disk exerts
        a significant torque on the star. On the assumption that the distortion of
        the residual stellar field lines threading the disk is limited by reconnection,
        the total accretion torque on the star is calculated. The calculated torque
        gives period changes in agreement with those observed in the pulsating X-ray
        sources and provides a natural explanation of why a fast rotator like Her
        X-1 has a spin-up rate much below the conventional estimate for slow rotators.
        It is shown that for such fast rotators, fluctuations in the mass-accretion
        rate can produce fluctuations in the accretion torque about 100 times larger.
        For sufficiently fast rotators or, equivalently, for sufficiently low accretion

        emission from the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1728-34. Pulsations at 363 Hz with
        amplitudes (rms) of 2.5%--10% are present in six of the eight bursts analyzed
        to date. The strongest were seen in two successive bursts recorded on 1996
        February 16 when the quiescent count rate was near the highest seen by PCA.
        The pulsations during these bursts show frequency changes of 1.5 Hz during
        the first few seconds but become effectively coherent as the burst decays.
        We interpret the 363 Hz pulsations as rotationally induced modulations of
        inhomogeneous burst emission. This represents the first compelling evidence
        for a millisecond spin period in a low-mass X-ray binary. Complex, intensity-dependent,
        millisecond X-ray variability is also present in all the quiescent flux intervals

        X-ray Transients (SXRTs) have long been suspected to contain old, weakly magnetic
        neutron stars that have been spun up by accretion torques. After reviewing
        their observational properties, we analyse the different regimes that likely
        characterise the neutron stars in these systems across the very large range
        of mass inflow rates, from the peak of the outbursts to the quiescent emission.
        While it is clear that close to the outburst maxima accretion onto the neutron
        star surface takes place, as the mass inflow rate decreases, accretion might
        stop at the magnetospheric boundary because of the centrifugal barrier provided
        by the neutron star. For low enough mass inflow rates (and sufficiently short
        rotation periods), the radio pulsar mechanism might turn on and sweep the
        inflowing matter away. The origin of the quiescent emission, observed in a
        number of SXRTs at a level of ~10<SUP>32</SUP>-10<SUP>33</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>,
        plays a crucial role in constraining the neutron star magnetic field and spin
        period. Accretion onto the neutron star surface is an unlikely mechanism for
        the quiescent emission of SXRTs, as it requires very low magnetic fields and/or
        long spin periods. Thermal radiation from a cooling neutron star surface in
        between the outbursts can be ruled out as the only cause of the quiescent
        emission. We find that accretion onto the neutron star magnetosphere and shock
        emission powered by an enshrouded radio pulsar provide far more plausible
        models. In the latter case the range of allowed neutron star spin periods
        and magnetic fields is consistent with the values recently inferred from the
        properties of kHz quasi-periodic oscillation in low mass X-ray binaries. If
        quiescent SXRTs contain enshrouded radio pulsars, they provide a missing link

        disk and also showed X-ray pulsations. We report on the first high time resolution
        observational campaign of this transitional pulsar in the disk state, using
        simultaneous observations in the optical (Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, Nordic
        Optical Telescope, Telescopi Joan Or\xF3), X-ray (XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, NICER),
        infrared (Gran Telescopio Canarias), and UV (Swift) bands. Optical and X-ray
        pulsations were detected simultaneously in the X-ray high-intensity mode in
        which the source spends \u223C70% of the time, and both disappeared in the
        low mode, indicating a common underlying physical mechanism. In addition,
        optical and X-ray pulses were emitted within a few kilometers and had similar
        pulse shapes and distributions of the pulsed flux density compatible with

        high mode; the lack of a simultaneous detection of X-ray pulses is compatible
        with the lower photon statistics. We show that magnetically channeled accretion

        model scans where possible. We tentatively identify an outflow in NGC 5204
        X-1, blueshifted to 0.34c, which produces emission features with a total significance
        of at least 3\u03C3. Next we compare ULXs with similar hardness ratios. Holmberg
        IX X-1 shows absorption features that could be associated with a photoionized
        outflowing absorber, similar to that seen in NGC 1313 X-1. The spectrum of
        Holmberg II X-1 possesses features similar to NGC 5408 X-1 and NGC 6946 X-1
        shows O VIII rest-frame emission. All other sources from the sample also show
        tentative evidence of spectral features in their high-resolution spectra.
        Further observations with the XMM-Newton and Chandra gratings will place stronger
        constraints. Future missions like XARM and Athena will be able to detect them
        at larger distances and increase our sample.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Kosec,

        simulations of the interaction of a rapidly rotating, magnetized star with
        an accretion disk. The disk is considered to have a finite viscosity and magnetic
        diffusivity. The main parameters of the system are the star's angular velocity
        and magnetic moment, and the disk's viscosity and diffusivity. We focus on
        the ``propeller'' regime where the inner radius of the disk is larger than
        the corotation radius. Two types of magnetohydrodynamic flows have been found
        as a result of simulations: ``weak'' and ``strong'' propellers. The strong
        propellers are characterized by a powerful disk wind and a collimated magnetically
        dominated outflow or jet from the star. The weak propellers have only weak
        outflows. We investigated the time-averaged characteristics of the interaction
        between the main elements of the system: the star, the disk, the wind from
        the disk, and the jet. Rates of exchange of mass and angular momentum between
        the elements of the system are derived as a function of the main parameters.
        The propeller mechanism may be responsible for the fast spinning down of the

        can be strongly affected by the interaction with its magnetic field. This
        occurs in a variety of astrophysical settings involving young stellar objects,
        white dwarfs, and neutron stars. As matter is endowed with angular momentum,
        its inflow toward the star is often mediated by an accretion disc. The pressure
        of matter and that originating from the stellar magnetic field balance at
        the magnetospheric radius: at smaller distances the motion of matter is dominated
        by the magnetic field, and funnelling towards the magnetic poles ensues. However,
        if the star, and thus its magnetosphere, is fast spinning, most of the inflowing
        matter will be halted at the magnetospheric radius by centrifugal forces,
        resulting in a characteristic reduction of the accretion luminosity. The onset
        of this mechanism, called the propeller, has been widely adopted to interpret
        a distinctive knee in the decaying phase of the light curve of several transiently
        accreting X-ray pulsar systems. By comparing the observed luminosity at the
        knee for different classes of objects with the value predicted by accretion
        theory on the basis of the independently measured magnetic field, spin period,
        mass, and radius of the star, we disclose here a general relation for the
        onset of the propeller which spans about eight orders of magnitude in spin

        and NuSTAR observations revealed a bimodal distribution of the X-ray count
        rates on timescales as short as tens of seconds, as well as sporadic flaring
        activity. The average broad-band (0.3-79 keV) spectrum was adequately described
        by an absorbed power law model with photon index of \u0393 = 1.63 \xB1 0.01

        analysis of PSR J1023+0038, which reveals that (1) its gamma-rays suddenly
        brightened within a few days in 2013 June/July and has remained at a high
        gamma-ray state for several months; (2) both UV and X-ray fluxes have increased

        associated with UV and X-rays are on the order of 100-500 s and 50-100 s,

        the sudden increase of the stellar wind, could explain the changes of all
        these observed features. The increase of UV is emitted from the disk, and
        a new component in gamma-rays is produced by inverse Compton scattering between
        the new UV component and pulsar wind. The increase of X-rays results from
        the enhancement of injection pulsar wind energy into the intra-binary shock

        pulsar population changed dramatically. Thanks to the large effective area
        and good time resolution of the NASA X-ray observatory Rossi X-ray Timing
        Explorer, we discovered that neutron stars in Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs)
        spins at frequencies between 200 and 750 Hz, and indirectly confirmed the
        recycling scenario, according to which neutron stars are spun up to millisecond
        periods during the LMXB-phase. In the meantime, the continuous discovery of
        rotation-powered millisecond pulsars in binary systems in the radio and gamma-ray
        band (mainly with the Fermi Large Area Telescope) allowed us to classify these
        sources into two \\\"spiders\\\" populations, depending on the mass of their
        companion stars: Black Widow pulsars, with very low-mass companion stars,
        and Redbacks, with larger mass companion stars possibly filling their Roche
        lobes without accretion of matter onto the neutron star. It was soon regained
        that millisecond pulsars in short orbital period LMXBs are the progenitors
        of the spider populations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, although
        a direct link between accretion-powered and rotation-powered millisecond pulsars
        was still missing. In 2013 the ESA X-ray observatory XMM-Newton spotted the
        X-ray outburst of a new accreting millisecond pulsar (IGR J18245-2452) in
        a source that was previously classified as a radio millisecond pulsar, probably
        of the Redback type. Follow up observations of the source when it went back
        to X-ray quiescence showed that it was able to swing between accretion-powered
        to rotation-powered pulsations in a relatively short timescale (few days),
        promoting this source as the direct link between the LMXB and the radio millisecond
        pulsar phases. Following discoveries showed that there exists a bunch of sources
        which alternates X-ray activity phases, showing X-ray coherent pulsations,
        to radio-loud phases, showing radio pulsations, establishing a new class of
        millisecond pulsars, the so-called transitional millisecond pulsars. In this

        and transitional millisecond pulsars, highlighting what we know and what we

        ray study of this source based on a recent XMM-Newton observation and archival
        INTEGRAL and RXTE data. Using the Fermi/LAT 1-year point source catalogue,
        we tentatively associate XSS J12270-4859 with 1FGL J1227.9-4852, a source
        of high-energy gamma rays with emission up to 10 GeV. We further complement
        the study with UV photometry from XMM-Newton and ground-based optical and
        near-IR photometry. <BR /> Methods: We have analysed both timing and spectral
        properties in the gamma rays, X-rays, UV and optical/near-IR bands of XSS
        J12270-4859. <BR /> Results: The X-ray emission is highly variable, showing
        flares and intensity dips. The flares consist of flare-dip pairs. Flares are
        detected in both X-rays and the UV range, while the subsequent dips are present
        only in the X-ray band. Further aperiodic dipping behaviour is observed during
        X-ray quiescence, but not in the UV. The broad-band 0.2-100 keV X-ray/soft
        gamma ray spectrum is featureless and well described by a power law model
        with \u0393 = 1.7. The high-energy spectrum from 100 MeV to 10 GeV is represented
        by a power law index of 2.45. The luminosity ratio between 0.1-100 GeV and
        0.2-100 keV is ~0.8, indicating that the GeV emission is a significant component
        of the total energy output. Furthermore, the X-ray spectrum does not greatly
        change during flares, quiescence and the dips seen in quiescence. The X-ray
        spectrum however hardens during the post-flare dips, where a partial covering
        absorber is also required to fit the spectrum. Optical photometry acquired
        at different epochs reveals a period of 4.32 hr that could be ascribed to
        the binary orbital period. Near-IR, possibly ellipsoidal, variations are detected.
        Large amplitude variability on shorter (tens mins) timescales is found to
        be non-periodic. <BR /> Conclusions: The observed variability at all wavelengths

        suggest a late-type K2-K5 companion star, a distance range of 1.4-3.6 kpc,
        and an orbital period of 7-9 h. A near-UV variability (\u22736 h) also suggests

        a scenario for the pulsar interaction with the accretion disk capable of explaining
        the observed behavior. We suggest that during the high mode the disk is truncated
        outside the light cylinder, allowing the pulsar wind to develop near the equatorial
        plane and strike the disk. The dissipative wind-disk collision energizes the
        disk particles and generates synchrotron emission, which peaks in the X-ray
        band and extends down to the optical band. The emission is modulated by the
        pulsar wind rotation, resulting in a pulse profile with two peaks 180\xB0
        apart. This picture explains the high mode luminosity, spectrum, and pulse
        profile (X-ray and optical) of PSR J1023+0038. It may also explain the X-ray

        penetrates the light cylinder only during the low X-ray mode. This penetration
        suppresses the dissipation caused by the pulsar wind-disk collision, and the

        grating in quasi-Littrow mode and in white pupil configuration. With two fibers
        of 100 micrometer core diameter for the object and the nearby sky, the complete
        optical spectrum from 370 - 860 nm is recorded in one single exposure on a
        2k X 4k thinned CCD with 15 micrometer pixels. Therefore, the instrument can
        work in a fixed configuration on the optical bench without movable parts besides
        the CCD shutter mechanics. For the highest-possible opto-mechanical stability.
        FEROS will be housed in a temperature and humidity controlled room in the
        former Coude room of the telescope. The resolving power of R equals 48,000
        is reached by the use of a newly designed two-slice image slicer which is

        has been recently the subject of multiwavelength monitoring campaigns which
        revealed that an accretion disc has formed around the neutron star (since
        2013 June). We present here the results of X-ray and UV observations carried
        out by the Swift satellite between 2013 October and 2014 May, and of optical
        and NIR observations performed with the REM telescope, the Liverpool Telescope,
        the 2.1-m telescope at the San Pedro M\xE1rtir Observatory and the 1.52-m
        telescope at the Loiano observing station. The X-ray spectrum is well described
        by an absorbed power law, which is softer than the previous quiescent epoch
        (up to 2013 June). The strong correlation between the X-ray and the UV emissions
        indicates that the same mechanism should be responsible for part of the emission
        in these bands. Optical and infrared photometric observations show that the
        companion star is strongly irradiated. Double-peaked emission lines in the
        optical spectra provide compelling evidence for the presence of an outer accretion
        disc too. The spectral energy distribution from IR to X-rays is well modelled
        if the contributions from the companion, the disc and the intrabinary shock
        emission are all considered. Our extensive data set can be interpreted in
        terms of an engulfed radio pulsar: the radio pulsar is still active, but undetectable
        in the radio band due to a large amount of ionized material surrounding the
        compact object. X-rays and gamma-rays are produced in an intrabinary shock
        front between the relativistic pulsar wind and matter from the companion and

        Cen X-4. We detect fast optical variations superposed on the secondary star's
        double-humped ellipsoidal modulation. The variability resembles typical flare
        activity and has amplitudes ranging from 0.06 to 0.6 mag. Flares occur on
        timescales of minutes to a few hours, with no dependency on orbital phase,
        and contribute ~19%-46% to the total veiling observed in the R band. We find
        that the observed level of flaring activity is veiled by the light of the
        companion star, and therefore, systems with cool companions (e.g., J0422+32)
        exhibit stronger variability. After correcting for this dilution, we do not
        find any correlation between the flaring activity and fundamental system parameters.
        We find no underlying coherent periods in the data, only quasi-periodic variations
        ranging between 30 and 90 minutes for the short-period SXTs and longer than
        1 hr for V404 Cyg. The power-law index of the power spectra is consistent
        with what is observed at X-rays wavelengths, i.e., a 1/f distribution, which
        is compatible with the cellular automaton model. Our observed R'-band luminosities,
        which are in the range 10<SUP>31</SUP>-10<SUP>33</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>,
        are too large to be due to chromospheric activity in the rapidly rotating

        dynamical (Keplerian) timescales suggest that flares are produced at ~0.3R<SUB>d</SUB>-0.7R<SUB>d</SUB>.
        Possible formation mechanisms are magnetic loop reconnection events in the

        exoplanets, recorded from primary transit and secondary eclipse measurements,
        indicate the presence of the most abundant carbon and oxygen molecular species
        (H2O, CH4, CO, and CO2) in a few exoplanets. However, efforts to constrain
        the molecular abundances to within several orders of magnitude are thwarted
        by the broad range of degenerate solutions that fit the data. Here we explore,
        with radiative transfer models and analytical approximations, the nature of
        the degenerate solution sets resulting from the sparse measurements of \\\"hot
        Jupiter\\\" exoplanets. As demonstrated with simple analytical expressions,
        primary transit measurements probe roughly 4 atmospheric scale heights at
        each wavelength band. Derived mixing ratios from these data are highly sensitive
        to errors in the radius in planet (at a reference pressure), which are approximately
        a few percent. For example, an uncertainty of 1% in the radius of a 1000 K
        and H2-based exoplanet with Jupiter's radius and mass, causes an uncertainty
        of a factor of ~100-10000 in the derived gas mixing ratios. The degree of
        sensitivity depends on how the line strength increases with the optical depth
        (i.e. the curve of growth) and the atmospheric scale height. Temperature degeneracies
        in the solutions of the primary transit data, which manifest their effects
        through scale height and absorption coefficients, are smaller. We argue that
        these challenges can be partially surmounted by a combination of selected
        wavelength sampling of optical and IR measurements and, when possible, the
        joint analysis of transit and secondary eclipse data of exoplanets.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Griffith,

        at different epochs after the transition to a rotation-powered radio pulsar
        state. The observations, while confirming the large-amplitude orbital modulation
        found in previous studies after the state change, also reveal an energy dependence
        of the amplitudes as well as variations on time-scale of months. The amplitude
        variations are anticorrelated in the X-ray and the UV/optical bands. The average
        X-ray spectrum is described by a power law with \u0393 index of 1.07(8) without
        requiring an additional thermal component. The power-law index \u0393 varies
        from \u223C1.2 to \u223C1.0 between superior and inferior conjunction of the

        Coronagraphic techniques are required for detecting exoplanets with future
        Extremely Large Telescopes. One concept, the Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph
        (APLC), combines an apodizer in the entrance aperture with a Lyot opaque mask
        in the focal plane. This paper presents the manufacturing and testing of a
        microdots apodizer optimized for the near IR. <BR />Aims: We attempt to demonstrate
        the feasibility and performance of binary apodizers for the APLC. This study
        is also relevant to coronagraph using amplitude pupil apodization. <BR />Methods:
        A binary apodizer was designed using a halftone-dot process, where the binary
        array of pixels with either 0% or 100% transmission was calculated to fit
        the required continuous transmission, i.e. local transmission control was
        obtained by varying the relative density of the opaque and transparent pixels.
        An error-diffusion algorithm was used to optimize the distribution of pixels
        that approximated the required field transmission. The prototype was tested
        with a coronagraphic setup in the near IR. <BR />Results: The transmission
        profile of the prototype agrees with the theoretical shape to within 3% and
        is achromatic. The observed apodized and coronagraphic images are consistent
        with theory. However, binary apodizers introduce high frequency noise that
        is a function of the pixel size. Numerical simulations were used to specify
        pixel size and minimize this effect, and validated by experiment. <BR />Conclusions:
        This paper demonstrates that binary apodizers are well suited for use in high-contrast
        imaging coronagraphs. The correct choice of pixel size is important and must
        be addressed by considering the scientific field of view.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Martinez,

        with a proposed persistent gamma-ray counterpart in the Fermi-Large Area Telescope
        domain, 2FGL 1227.7-4853. Here, we present the results of the analysis of
        recent INTEGRAL observations, aimed at assessing the long-term variability
        of the hard X-ray emission, and thus the stability of the accretion state.
        We confirm that the source behaves as a persistent hard X-ray emitter between
        2003 and 2012. We propose that XSS J12270-4859 hosts a neutron star in a propeller
        state, a state we investigate in detail, developing a theoretical model to
        reproduce the associated X-ray and gamma-ray properties. This model can be
        understood as being of a more general nature, representing a viable alternative
        by which LMXBs can appear as gamma-ray sources. In particular, this may apply
        to the case of millisecond pulsars performing a transition from a state powered
        by the rotation of their magnetic field to a state powered by matter infall,
        such as that recently observed from the transitional pulsar PSR J1023+0038.
        While the surface magnetic field of a typical neutron star (NS) in an LMXB
        is lower by more than four orders of magnitude than the much more intense
        fields of neutron stars accompanying high-mass binaries, the radius at which
        the matter inflow is truncated in an NS-LMXB system is much smaller. The magnetic
        field at the magnetospheric interface is then orders of magnitude larger at
        this interface, and as consequence, so is the power to accelerate electrons.
        We demonstrate that the cooling of the accelerated electron population takes
        place mainly through synchrotron interaction with the magnetic field permeating
        the interface, and through inverse Compton losses due to the interaction between
        the electrons and the synchrotron photons they emit. We found that self-synchrotron
        Compton processes can explain the high-energy phenomenology of XSS J12270-4859.\",\n

        is focused on the search for intrinsically linearly polarised optical emission
        from the two systems. To this aim, we carried out multiband optical (BVRi)
        and near-infrared (NIR; JHK) photo-polarimetric observations of the two systems
        using the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) at La Silla (Chile), equipped
        with the EFOSC2 and the SOFI instruments. The system XSS J12270-4859 was observed
        during its radio-pulsar state; we did not detect a significant degree of polarisation
        in any of the bands, with 3\u03C3 upper limits, for example, of 1.4% in the
        R-band. We built the NIR-optical averaged spectral energy distribution (SED)
        of the system, which could be described well by an irradiated black body with
        radius R<SUB>\u2217</SUB> = 0.33 \xB1 0.03 R<SUB>\u2299</SUB> and albedo \u03B7
        = 0.32 \xB1 0.05, without the need for further components. Thus, we excluded
        the visible presence of an extended accretion disc and/or of relativistic
        jets. The case was different for PSR J1023+0038, which was in its accretion
        phase during our campaign. We measured a linear polarisation of 1.09 \xB1
        0.27% and 0.90 \xB1 0.17% in the V and R bands, respectively. The phase-resolved
        polarimetric curve of the source in the R band reveals a hint of a sinusoidal
        modulation at the source 4.75 h orbital period, peaked at the same orbital
        phase as the light curve. The measured optical polarisation of PSR J1023+0038
        could, in principle, be interpreted as electron scattering with free electrons,
        which can be found in the accretion disc of the system or even in the hot
        corona that sorrounds the disc itself, or as synchrotron emission from a jet
        of relativistic particles or an outflow. However, the NIR-optical SED of the
        system built from our dataset did not suggest the presence of a jet. We conclude
        that the optical linear polarisation observed for PSR J1023+0038 is possibly
        due to Thomson scattering with electrons in the disc, as is also suggested
        from the possible modulation of the R-band linear polarisation at the system
        orbital period. <P />Based on observations made with European Southern Observatory

        dependence of the magnetic moment m obtained from the hysteresis loops on

        on the basis of Anderson's interpretation of the magnetic flux creep. In addition,
        a phenomenological model is suggested which predicts a linear dependence of
        m on ln \u2016dot H\u2016 with the slope \u2202 m/\u2202 ln \u2016dot H\u2016,
        numerically equal to the relaxation rate \u2202 m/\u2202 ln (t) from the usual
        magnetic relaxation. Such linear relations between m and ln \u2016dot H\u2016
        were observed experimentally in single crystals of YBaCuO. Preliminary experiments
        on the complementary time dependent relaxation of m after a simulated step

        values. The model here presented also enables one to compare the critical

        of corrosion inhibitors open new opportunities for long-term anticorrosion
        protection of different metallic materials. In this paper a new type of functional
        nanoreservoir based on silica nanocapsules (SiNC) synthesized and loaded with
        corrosion inhibitor 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) in a one-stage process is
        reported for the first time. Unlike conventional mesoporous silica nanoparticles,
        SiNC possess an empty core and shell with gradual mesoporosity, arising from
        the particular conditions of the synthetic route adopted, which confers significant
        loading capacity and allows prolonged and stimuli-triggered release of the
        inhibiting species. The kinetics of inhibitor release was studied at different
        pH values and concentrations of NaCl. The results show a clear dependence
        of the release profiles on corrosion relevant triggers such as pH and Cl<SUP>-</SUP>
        concentration. When SiNC loaded with MBT are dispersed in NaCl solution, there
        is a significant decrease of the corrosion activity on aluminium alloy 2024.
        More importantly, when SiNC-MBT is added to a conventional water-based coating
        formulation, the modified coating hampers corrosion activity at the metal
        interface, better than in the case of direct addition of corrosion inhibitor.
        Furthermore, self-healing is observed before and after artificially inflicting
        defects in the modified coatings. As a result, the developed nanocontainers
        show high potential to be used in new generation of active protective coatings.\",\n

        of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN

        set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used

        the vacuum energy density, Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0),
        and the dynamical age of the universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift

        different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M

        error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample
        selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing,
        and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile
        the data with Omega_Lambda = 0 and q_0 &gt;= 0.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Riess,

        paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations
        of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background
        (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis
        of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision.
        The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard
        spatially-flat 6-parameter \u039BCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of
        adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted \\\"base \u039BCDM\\\" in this paper).
        From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology
        we find a Hubble constant, H<SUB>0</SUB> = (67.8 \xB1 0.9) km s<SUP>-1</SUP>Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>,
        a matter density parameter \u03A9<SUB>m</SUB> = 0.308 \xB1 0.012, and a tilted
        scalar spectral index with n<SUB>s</SUB> = 0.968 \xB1 0.006, consistent with
        the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68% confidence limits
        on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters. We present
        the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument
        at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing
        data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of \u03C4 = 0.066
        \xB1 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of z_re=8.8<SUP>+1.7</SUP><SUB>-1.4</SUB>.
        These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements
        cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency
        Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base \u039BCDM in the
        neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations
        with other astrophysical data we find N<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3.15 \xB1 0.23 for
        the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the
        value N<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The
        sum of neutrino masses is constrained to \u2211 m<SUB>\u03BD</SUB> &lt; 0.23
        eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero,
        with | \u03A9<SUB>K</SUB> | &lt; 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter
        extension to base \u039BCDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar
        ratio of r<SUB>0.002</SUB>&lt; 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results
        and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis
        of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to
        our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of r<SUB>0.002</SUB> &lt; 0.09
        and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V(\u03C6) \u221D \u03C6<SUP>2</SUP>
        potential. The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints
        on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no
        evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic
        defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type
        Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w =
        -1.006 \xB1 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant.
        The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium
        abundances for the best-fit Planck base \u039BCDM cosmology are in excellent
        agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter
        and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither
        case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base \u039BCDM
        are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA
        sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude
        of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some
        analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that
        these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the
        base \u039BCDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base \u039BCDM cosmology
        provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many
        other astrophysical data sets. <P /></SUP>\",\n        \"author\":[\"Planck

        Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae,

        from the Cal\xE1n/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield
        values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are
        standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement

        The data are strongly inconsistent with a \u039B=0 flat cosmology, the simplest
        inflationary universe model. An open, \u039B=0 cosmology also does not fit
        the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero
        and positive, with a confidence of P(\u039B&gt;0)=99%, including the identified
        systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the

        find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution
        or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Cal\xE1n/Tololo sample and our
        high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in
        color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The

        have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting
        states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination
        of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional
        (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close
        cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological
        insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface.
        In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and
        superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which
        the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments
        on HgTe/CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of
        the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments

        materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of
        their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface
        of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap
        leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric
        effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana
        fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological
        quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also
        discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.\",\n

        exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free
        (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations
        to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and
        correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction
        correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the
        self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational
        principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although
        the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential,
        the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply
        the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content
        of the exchange-correlation hole, while substantially improving the description
        of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where
        the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic
        improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction.
        Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the
        total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii)
        accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in
        LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that
        closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v)
        correct longrange behavior of the potential and density. It appears that SIC
        can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown
        by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate
        of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic
        Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost
        unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation

        Observatory Schmidt, and the United Kingdom Schmidt, the InfraRed Astronomical
        Satellite, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey have proven to be extremely useful
        tools for astronomy with value that lasts for decades. The Wide-field Infrared
        Survey Explorer (WISE) is mapping the whole sky following its launch on 2009
        December 14. WISE began surveying the sky on 2010 January 14 and completed
        its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to
        cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted (anticipated in
        2010 November). WISE is achieving 5\u03C3 point source sensitivities better
        than 0.08, 0.11, 1, and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands
        centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 \u03BCm. Sensitivity improves
        toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background.
        The angular resolution is 6farcs1, 6farcs4, 6farcs5, and 12farcs0 at 3.4,
        4.6, 12, and 22 \u03BCm, and the astrometric precision for high signal-to-noise

        \       \"abstract\":\"Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme
        of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved
        in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was
        changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload
        were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community
        focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing
        and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on
        19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point
        of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the
        spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year
        mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently
        transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of
        Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016)
        being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload
        module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance
        of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings,
        followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific
        performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate
        Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia
        Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. <P /><A href=\\\"http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia\\\">http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia</A>\",\n

        cosmological consequences of a pervasive, rolling, self-interacting, homogeneous
        scalar field are investigated. A number of models in which the energy density
        of the scalar field red-shifts in a specific manner are studied. In these
        models the current epoch is chosen to be scalar-field dominated to agree with
        dynamical estimates of the density parameter, \u03A9<SUB>dyn~0.2</SUB>, and
        zero spatial curvature. The required scalar-field potential is ``nonlinear''
        and decreases in magnitude as the value of the scalar field increases. A special
        solution of the field equations which is an attractive, time-dependent, fixed
        point is presented. These models are consistent with the classical tests of
        gravitation theory. The E\xF6tv\xF6s-Dicke measurements strongly constrain
        the coupling of the scalar field to light (nongravitational) fields. Nucleosynthesis
        proceeds as in the standard hot big-bang model. In linear perturbation theory
        the behavior of baryonic perturbations, in the baryon-dominated epoch, do
        not differ significantly from the canonical scenario, while the presence of
        a substantial amount of homogeneous scalar-field energy density at low red-shifts
        inhibits the growth of perturbations in the baryonic fluid. The energy density
        in the scalar field is not appreciably perturbed by nonrelativistic gravitational
        fields, either in the radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, or scalar-field-dominated
        epochs. On the basis of this effect, we argue that these models could reconcile
        the low dynamical estimates of the mean mass density with the negligibly small
        spatial curvature preferred by inflation.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Ratra,

        study focuses on the improved estimation of mesoscale surface ocean circulation
        obtained by merging TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) and ERS-1 and -2 altimeter measurements
        between October 1992 and May 1998. Once carefully intercalibrated and homogenized,
        these data are merged through an advanced global objective analysis method
        that allows us to correct for residual long wavelength errors and uses realistic
        correlation scales of ocean dynamics. The high-resolution (0.25\xB0\xD70.25\xB0)
        merged T/P+ERS-1 and -2 sea level anomaly maps provide more homogeneous and
        reduced mapping errors than either individual data set and more realistic
        sea level and geostrophic velocity statistics than T/P data alone. Furthermore,
        the merged T/P+ERS-1 and -2 maps yield eddy kinetic energy (EKE) levels 30%
        higher than maps of T/P alone. They also permit realistic global estimates
        of east and north components of EKE and their seasonal variations, to study
        EKE sources better. A comparison of velocity statistics with World Ocean Circulation
        Experiment surface drifters in the North Atlantic shows very good agreement.
        Comparison with contemporary current meter data in various oceanic regimes
        also produces comparable levels of energy and similar ratios of northward
        and eastward energy, showing that the maps are suitable to studying anisotropy.
        The T/P + ERS zonal and meridional components of the mapped currents usually
        present comparable rms variability, even though the variability in the Atlantic
        is more isotropic than that in the Pacific, which exhibits strong zonal changes.
        The EKE map presents a very detailed description, presumably never before
        achieved at a global scale. Pronounced seasonal changes of the EKE are found
        in many regions, notably the northeastern Pacific, the northeastern and northwestern
        Atlantic, the tropical oceans, and the zonally extended bands centered near
        20\xB0S in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans and at 20\xB0N in the northwestern

        in a strained low-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor. Here we demonstrate
        that strong magnetic fields can be induced in ferromagnetic metal films lacking
        structure inversion symmetry through the Rashba effect. Owing to the combination
        of spin-orbit and exchange interactions, we show that an electric current
        flowing in the plane of a Co layer with asymmetric Pt and AlO<SUB>x</SUB>
        interfaces produces an effective transverse magnetic field of 1Tper10<SUP>8</SUP>Acm<SUP>-2</SUP>.
        Besides its fundamental significance, the high efficiency of this process
        makes it a realistic candidate for room-temperature spintronic applications.\",\n

        is one of the cornerstones of understanding planet formation and evolution.
        Resonant systems are especially important as the fragility of their orbital
        configuration ensures that no significant scattering or collisional event
        has taken place since the earliest formation phase when the parent protoplanetary
        disc was still present. In this context, TOI-178 has been the subject of particular
        attention since the first TESS observations hinted at the possible presence
        of a near 2:3:3 resonant chain. Here we report the results of observations
        from CHEOPS, ESPRESSO, NGTS, and SPECULOOS with the aim of deciphering the
        peculiar orbital architecture of the system. We show that TOI-178 harbours
        at least six planets in the super-Earth to mini-Neptune regimes, with radii
        ranging from 1.152<SUB>\u22120.070</SUB><SUP>+0.073</SUP> to 2.87<SUB>\u22120.13</SUB><SUP>+0.14</SUP>
        Earth radii and periods of 1.91, 3.24, 6.56, 9.96, 15.23, and 20.71 days.
        All planets but the innermost one form a 2:4:6:9:12 chain of Laplace resonances,
        and the planetary densities show important variations from planet to planet,
        jumping from 1.02<SUB>\u22120.23</SUB><SUP>+0.28</SUP> to 0.177<SUB>\u22120.061</SUB><SUP>+0.055</SUP>
        times the Earth's density between planets c and d. Using Bayesian interior
        structure retrieval models, we show that the amount of gas in the planets
        does not vary in a monotonous way, contrary to what one would expect from
        simple formation and evolution models and unlike other known systems in a
        chain of Laplace resonances. The brightness of TOI-178 (H = 8.76 mag, J =
        9.37 mag, V = 11.95 mag) allows for a precise characterisation of its orbital
        architecture as well as of the physical nature of the six presently known
        transiting planets it harbours. The peculiar orbital configuration and the
        diversity in average density among the planets in the system will enable the
        study of interior planetary structures and atmospheric evolution, providing
        important clues on the formation of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Leleu,

        models for semantic segmentation are based on adaptations of convolutional

        segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are
        experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight
        convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful
        tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly
        control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep
        Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the
        field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing
        the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose
        atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple
        scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at
        multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects
        as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization
        of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical
        models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling
        in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome
        this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected
        Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively
        to improve localization performance. Our proposed \\\"DeepLab\\\" system sets

        has been suggested that an advanced civilization might have the technology
        to warp spacetime so that closed timelike curves would appear, allowing travel
        into the past. This paper examines this possibility in the case that the causality
        violations appear in a finite region of spacetime without curvature singularities.
        There will be a Cauchy horizon that is compactly generated and that in general
        contains one or more closed null geodesics which will be incomplete. One can
        define geometrical quantities that measure the Lorentz boost and area increase
        on going round these closed null geodesics. If the causality violation developed
        from a noncompact initial surface, the averaged weak energy condition must
        be violated on the Cauchy horizon. This shows that one cannot create closed
        timelike curves with finite lengths of cosmic string. Even if violations of
        the weak energy condition are allowed by quantum theory, the expectation value
        of the energy-momentum tensor would get very large if timelike curves become
        almost closed. It seems the back reaction would prevent closed timelike curves

        materials exhibit intrinsic `easy' and `hard' directions of the magnetization.
        This magnetic anisotropy is, from both a technological and fundamental viewpoint
        one of the most important properties of magnetic materials. The magnetic anisotropy
        in metallic magnetic multilayers forms the subject of this review article.
        As individual layers in a multilayer stack become thinner, the role of interfaces
        and surfaces may dominate that of the bulk: this is the case in many magnetic
        multilayers, where a perpendicular interface contribution to the magnetic
        anisotropy is capable of rotating the easy magnetization direction from in
        the film plane to perpendicular to the film plane. In this review, we show
        that the (in-plane) volume and (perpendicular) interface contribution to the
        magnetic anisotropy have been separated into terms related to mechanical stresses,
        crystallographic structure and the planar shape of the films. In addition,
        the effect of roughness, often inherent to the deposition techniques used,
        has been addressed theoretically. Several techniques to prepare multilayers
        and to characterize their growth as well as methods to determine the magnetic
        anisotropy are discussed. A comprehensive survey of experimental studies on
        the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in metallic multilayers containing Fe,
        Co or Ni is presented and commented on. Two major subjects of this review
        are the extrinsic effects of strain, roughness and interdiffusion and the
        intrinsic effect of the crystallographic orientation on the magnetic anisotropy.
        Both effects are investigated with the help of some dedicated experimental
        studies. The results of the orientational dependence studies are compared
        with ab initio calculations. Finally, the perpendicular surface anisotropy

        currents provide a powerful means of manipulating the magnetization of nanodevices,
        and give rise to spin transfer torques that can drive magnetic domain walls

        in the opposite direction to that expected from bulk spin transfer torques,
        and also at much higher speeds. Here we show that this is due to two intertwined

        domain walls. This chiral effective field arises from a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
        interaction at the Co/Pt interfaces and, in concert with spin Hall currents,
        drives the domain walls in lock-step along the nanowire. Elucidating the mechanism
        for the manipulation of domain walls in ultrathin magnetic films will enable
        the development of new families of spintronic devices.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Ryu,

        potential exhibits a localized-delocalized transition for increasingly attractive
        interactions. We develop here a renormalization-group approach to study this
        transition. Our treatment allows us to obtain the phase diagram and the exponents
        of the correlation functions in the delocalized regime. The boundary between
        the two regimes is found to depend both on disorder and the strength of the
        interactions. For (nearly) spin-isotropic interactions the delocalized phase
        is dominated by superconducting fluctuations of either singlet or triplet
        type. The temperature dependence of the conductivity in the delocalized phase
        is also obtained and a nonuniversal power-law behavior is found. A description
        of the crossover towards the localized phase is given and the localization
        length is computed. An analogous description is developed for the localized-superfluid
        transition of a one-dimensional boson gas. In this case the transition to
        the localized regime occurs for increasingly repulsive interactions. We suggest

        of ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT). It was designed for ultra-high radial-velocity
        (RV) precision and extreme spectral fidelity with the aim of performing exoplanet
        research and fundamental astrophysical experiments with unprecedented precision
        and accuracy. It is able to observe with any of the four Unit Telescopes (UTs)
        of the VLT at a spectral resolving power of 140 000 or 190 000 over the 378.2
        to 788.7 nm wavelength range; it can also observe with all four UTs together,
        turning the VLT into a 16 m diameter equivalent telescope in terms of collecting
        area while still providing a resolving power of 70 000. <BR /> Aims: We provide
        a general description of the ESPRESSO instrument, report on its on-sky performance,
        and present our Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program along with its first
        results. <BR /> Methods: ESPRESSO was installed on the Paranal Observatory
        in fall 2017. Commissioning (on-sky testing) was conducted between December
        2017 and September 2018. The instrument saw its official start of operations
        on October 1, 2018, but improvements to the instrument and recommissioning
        runs were conducted until July 2019. <BR /> Results: The measured overall
        optical throughput of ESPRESSO at 550 nm and a seeing of 0.65\u2033 exceeds
        the 10% mark under nominal astroclimatic conditions. We demonstrate an RV
        precision of better than 25 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP> during a single night and 50
        cm s<SUP>-1</SUP> over several months. These values being limited by photon
        noise and stellar jitter shows that the performance is compatible with an
        instrumental precision of 10 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP>. No difference has been measured
        across the UTs, neither in throughput nor RV precision. <BR /> Conclusions:
        The combination of the large collecting telescope area with the efficiency
        and the exquisite spectral fidelity of ESPRESSO opens a new parameter space
        in RV measurements, the study of planetary atmospheres, fundamental constants,
        stellar characterization, and many other fields. <P />Based on GTOs collected

        learning thrives with large neural networks and large datasets. However, larger
        networks and larger datasets result in longer training times that impede research
        and development progress. Distributed synchronous SGD offers a potential solution
        to this problem by dividing SGD minibatches over a pool of parallel workers.
        Yet to make this scheme efficient, the per-worker workload must be large,
        which implies nontrivial growth in the SGD minibatch size. In this paper,
        we empirically show that on the ImageNet dataset large minibatches cause optimization
        difficulties, but when these are addressed the trained networks exhibit good
        generalization. Specifically, we show no loss of accuracy when training with
        large minibatch sizes up to 8192 images. To achieve this result, we adopt
        a hyper-parameter-free linear scaling rule for adjusting learning rates as
        a function of minibatch size and develop a new warmup scheme that overcomes
        optimization challenges early in training. With these simple techniques, our
        Caffe2-based system trains ResNet-50 with a minibatch size of 8192 on 256

        made from R/P Flip using rapid profiling conductivity, temperature, and depth
        probes and vector-measuring current meters provide a new and detailed look
        at the diurnal cycle of the upper ocean. A diurnal cycle occurs when solar
        heating warms and stabilizes the upper ocean. This limits the downward penetration
        of turbulent wind mixing so that air-sea fluxes of heat and momentum are surface
        trapped during midday. The central problem is to learn how the trapping depth
        D<SUB>T</SUB> (mean depth value of the diurnal temperature and velocity response)
        is set by the competing effects of wind mixing and surface heating. In this
        data set the diurnal range of surface temperature T\u223Cs was observed to
        vary from 0.05&lt;T\u223Cs&lt;0.4\xB0C, with most of the day-to-day variability
        attributable to variations of wind stress \u03C4. Wind mixing causes a pronounced
        asymmetry of the T<SUB>s</SUB> response by limiting the warming phase to only
        about half of the period that the surface heat flux Q is positive. The associated
        wind-driven current, the diurnal jet, has an amplitude of typically V\u223Cs\u22480.1
        m s-1, with no obvious dependence upon \u03C4. The diurnal jet accelerates
        downwind during the morning and midday. It is turned into the wind by the
        Coriolis force during early evening and is often erased by the following morning.
        Under the assumption that wind mixing occurs as an adjustment to shear flow
        stability, a scaling analysis and a numerical model study show that the daily
        minimum trapping depth D\u223CT goes like \u03C4/Q<SUP>1/2</SUP>. It follows
        that T\u223Cs goes like Q<SUP>3/2</SUP>/\u03C4 and that V\u223Cs goes like
        Q<SUP>1/2</SUP>. These results, as well as the simulated time dependence of
        the diurnal cycle, are at least roughly consistent with the observations.
        The observed time-averaged velocity profile has a spiral shape reminiscent
        of the classical Ekman spiral. However, its structure is a consequence of
        diurnal cycling, and its parameter dependence is in some ways just opposite
        that of the Ekman model; e.g., increased wind stress may cause decreased vertical
        shear between fixed levels in the upper ocean.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Price,

        tractable, even with large data sets. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular
        class of models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales,
        in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has

        performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity
        (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network,
        which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair
        in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations
        (~65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic
        similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this
        publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained
        BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically
        meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity.
        This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with
        BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy
        from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer

        giant planets through a coupling effect of mutual scattering, the Kozai mechanism,
        and tidal circularization, by orbital integrations. Close-in gas giants would
        have been originally formed at several AU beyond the ice lines in protoplanetary
        disks and migrated close to their host stars. Although type II migration due
        to planet-disk interactions may be a major channel for the migration, we show
        that this scattering process would also give a nonnegligible contribution.
        We carried out orbital integrations of three planets with Jupiter mass, directly
        including the effect of tidal circularization. We have found that in about
        30% of the runs close-in planets are formed, which is much higher than suggested
        by previous studies. Three-planet orbit crossing usually results in the ejection
        of one or two planets. Tidal circularization often occurs during three-planet
        orbit crossing, but previous studies have monitored only the final stage after
        the ejection, significantly underestimating the formation probability. We
        have found that the Kozai mechanism in outer planets is responsible for the
        formation of close-in planets. During three-planet orbital crossing, Kozai
        excitation is repeated and the eccentricity is often increased secularly to
        values close enough to unity for tidal circularization to transform the inner
        planet to a close-in planet. Since a moderate eccentricity can retain for
        the close-in planet, this mechanism may account for the observed close-in
        planets with moderate eccentricities and without nearby secondary planets.
        Since these planets also remain a broad range of orbital inclinations (even
        retrograde ones), the contribution of this process would be clarified by more
        observations of Rossiter-McLaughlin effects for transiting planets.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Nagasawa,

        relations between various treatments of the classical linearly damped harmonic

        classical Hamiltonian and the quantum mechanical S\xFCssmann-Hasse-Albrecht
        models as coined by the M\xFCnchen/Garching nuclear physics group. It is shown
        how y imposing a restriction on the classical trajectories in order to connect

        Hamiltonian leads to thetime-dependent Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian. Canonical
        quantization of either formulation entails a violation of Heisenberg's principle.
        By means of a unified treatment of both the electrical and mechanical semi-infinite
        transmission line, this defect is related to the disregard of additional quantum
        fluctuations that are intrinsically connected with the dissipation. The difficulties
        of these models are discussed. Then it is proved that the Bateman dual Hamiltonian
        is connected to a recently developed complex symplectic formulation by a simple
        canonical transformation. The fundamental commutator is still in error. Therefore

        phase space by an integration over the mirror image subspace, a quantum continuity

        by transfer of angular momentum from light to the material raises the possibility
        of optically driven micromachines. The phenomenon has been observed using
        elliptically polarized laser beams or beams with helical phase structure,.
        But it is difficult to develop high power in such experiments because of overheating
        and unwanted axial forces, limiting the achievable rotation rates to a few
        hertz. This problem can in principle be overcome by using transparent particles,
        transferring angular momentum by a mechanism first observed by Beth in 1936,
        when he reported a tiny torque developed in a quartz `wave-plate' owing to
        the change in polarization of transmitted light. Here we show that an optical
        torque can be induced on microscopic birefringent particles of calcite held
        by optical tweezers. Depending on the polarization of the incident beam, the
        particles either become aligned with the plane of polarization (and thus can
        be rotated through specified angles) or spin with constant rotation frequency.
        Because these microscopic particles are transparent, they can be held in three-dimensional
        optical traps at very high power without heating, leading to rotation rates
        of over 350Hz.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Friese, M. E. J.\",\n          \"Nieminen,

        shear its external magnetic field, which becomes nonpotential and threaded
        by an electric current. Once twisted, the magnetosphere cannot untwist immediately
        because of its self-induction. The self-induction electric field lifts particles
        from the stellar surface, accelerates them, and initiates avalanches of pair
        creation in the magnetosphere. The created plasma corona maintains the electric
        current demanded by b.nabla XB and regulates the self-induction EMF by screening.
        This corona persists in dynamic equilibrium: it is continually lost to the
        stellar surface on the light crossing time ~10<SUP>-4</SUP> s and replenished
        with new particles. In essence, the twisted magnetosphere acts as an accelerator
        that converts the toroidal field energy to particle kinetic energy. Using
        a direct numerical experiment, we show that the corona self-organizes quickly

        accelerated in the corona impact the solid crust, knock out protons, and regulate
        the column density of the hydrostatic atmosphere of the star. The transition

        \       \"abstract\":\"The mixed layer of the western equatorial Pacific and
        its thermodynamics are poorly known because of a general lack of data. Conductivity-temperature-depth
        (CTD) profiles from the recent Western Equatorial Pacific Ocean Circulation
        Study (WEPOCS) cruises have been analyzed for various measures of the upper
        layer and mixed layer thickness, using criteria which depend on vertical gradients
        of temperature, salinity, and density. From 434 profiles, the average mixed
        layer depth in the western equatorial Pacific during the two WEPOCS cruises
        was 29 m, which is about a factor of 3 shallower than had previously been
        thought. The mean depth of the top of the thermocline was found to be 64 m,
        so there is a nearly isothermal layer that is deeper than the mixed layer.
        This discrepancy is attributable to salinity stratification. It is hypothesized
        that the waters in this \u201Cbarrier\u201D layer between the bottom of the
        mixed layer and the top of the thermocline are formed to the east of the WEPOCS
        region, and subducted below the shallow and lighter mixed layer waters found
        in the west. Under light wind conditions, there was a tendency for warm and
        thin layers to form at the sea surface as a result of diurnal heating; however,
        there did not appear to be any nighttime maximum to the mixed layer depth
        associated with convective overturn due to cooling. This contrast with the
        central Pacific may be caused by the influence of salinity on the thermodynamics
        of the mixed layer. A strong westerly wind burst was observed during WEPOCS
        II, and apparently the mixed layer nearly doubled in depth while cooling by
        more than 1\xB0C. Evidence of downwelling near the equator, and upwelling
        off the equator, was seen in the distribution of temperature, salinity, and
        density in the meridional section along 143\xB0E, which was occupied immediately
        following the wind event. This event was apparently strong enough to erode
        through the salinity-stratified layer and into the thermocline, resulting
        in the observed cooling. The results of this study suggest that except during
        strong wind events, entrainment cooling may not be an important component
        of the heat budget of the western Pacific warm pool. This has potentially
        important implications for the El Ni\xF1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.\",\n

        study in this paper the different physical processes involved in laser-produced
        plasma in confined geometry. With this technique, a laser irradiates a target
        at an intensity of a few GW/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, and the produced plasma is confined
        by a transparent overlay to the laser which covers this target. This configuration
        has appeared necessary for example for metallurgical applications where, for
        a given laser energy, enhanced pressures must be realized in order to achieve
        high shock pressures. Therefore, a physical study of this method is useful
        in order to optimize this technique. We have first developed an analytical
        model which describes the different steps involved in this process, points
        out the interest of this technique, and compares it to the direct ablation
        regime. In the first stage, during the laser heating, the generated pressure
        is typically 4-10 times greater than the corresponding one obtained in direct
        ablation. The second step begins after the switch-off of the laser and is
        characterized by an adiabatic cooling of the plasma which maintains the applied
        pressure over a period which is about 2 times the laser-pulse duration. Finally,
        the third stage concerns also the adiabatic cooling of the recombined plasma,
        but during this period the exerted pressure is too small to realize a plastic
        deformation of the material. <P />We show that the impulse momentum given
        to the target is mainly generated during this step. This model allows us to
        also determine the velocities of thin foils accelerated with confined plasmas,
        and we show that very high hydrodynamic efficiencies can be achieved by this
        technique. Experimentally, we measured with quartz gauges, the pressures obtained
        in confined geometry, for 30-, 3-, and 0.6-ns laser-pulse duration. This study
        shows that short pulse durations are sensitive to the initial roughness of
        the interface, and such an effect should be suppressed by using a liquid confinement.
        Then, we conclude that a large fraction of the absorbed laser energy (80%-90%)
        is used for the ionization of the medium in these conditions of irradiation.
        Finally, we experimentally point out that the laser-induced breakdown of the
        confining medium is the main mechanism which limits the generated pressure
        and show the influence of the laser-pulse duration on this effect.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Fabbro,

        \       \"abstract\":\"Doping-the intentional introduction of impurities into
        a material-is fundamental to controlling the properties of bulk semiconductors.
        This has stimulated similar efforts to dope semiconductor nanocrystals. Despite
        some successes, many of these efforts have failed, for reasons that remain
        unclear. For example, Mn can be incorporated into nanocrystals of CdS and
        ZnSe (refs 7-9), but not into CdSe (ref. 12)-despite comparable bulk solubilities
        of near 50per cent. These difficulties, which have hindered development of
        new nanocrystalline materials, are often attributed to `self-purification',
        an allegedly intrinsic mechanism whereby impurities are expelled. Here we
        show instead that the underlying mechanism that controls doping is the initial
        adsorption of impurities on the nanocrystal surface during growth. We find
        that adsorption-and therefore doping efficiency-is determined by three main
        factors: surface morphology, nanocrystal shape, and surfactants in the growth
        solution. Calculated Mn adsorption energies and equilibrium shapes for several
        nanocrystals lead to specific doping predictions. These are confirmed by measuring
        how the Mn concentration in ZnSe varies with nanocrystal size and shape. Finally,
        we use our predictions to incorporate Mn into previously undopable CdSe nanocrystals.
        This success establishes that earlier difficulties with doping are not intrinsic,
        and suggests that a variety of doped nanocrystals-for applications from solar
        cells to spintronics-can be anticipated.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Erwin,

        New photometric space missions to detect and characterise transiting exoplanets
        are focusing on bright stars to obtain high cadence, high signal-to-noise
        light curves. Since these missions will be sensitive to stellar oscillations
        and granulation even for dwarf stars, they will be limited by stellar variability.
        Therefore, it is crucial and timely to develop robust methods to account for
        and correct for stellar variability. <BR /> Aims: We tested the performance
        of Gaussian process (GP) regression on the characterisation of transiting
        planets, and in particular to determine how many components of variability
        are necessary to describe high cadence, high signal-to-noise light curves
        expected from CHEOPS and PLATO. To achieve this, we selected a sample of bright
        stars observed in the asteroseismology field of CoRoT at high cadence (32
        s) and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). <BR /> Methods: We used GPs to model
        stellar variability including different combinations of stellar oscillations,
        granulation, and rotational modulation models. We preformed model comparison
        to find the best activity model fit to our data. We compared the best multi-component
        model with the usual one-component model used for transit retrieval and with
        a non-GP model. <BR /> Results: We found that the best GP stellar variability
        model contains four to five variability components: one stellar oscillation
        component, two to four granulation components, and/or one rotational modulation
        component, which is consistent with results from asteroseismology. However,
        this high number of components is in contrast with the one-component GP model
        (1GP) commonly used in the literature for transit characterisation. Therefore,
        we compared the performance of the best multi-component GP model with the
        1GP model in the derivation of transit parameters of simulated transits. We
        found that for Jupiter- and Neptune-size planets the best multi-component
        GP model is slightly better than the 1GP model, and much better than the non-GP
        model that gives biased results. For Earth-size planets, the 1GP model fails
        to retrieve the transit because it is a poor description of stellar activity.
        The non-GP model gives some biased results and the best multi-component GP
        is capable of retrieving the correct transit model parameters. <BR /> Conclusions:
        We conclude that when characterising transiting exoplanets with high S/Ns
        and high cadence light curves, we need models that couple the description
        of stellar variability with the transits analysis, like GPs. Moreover, for
        Earth-like exoplanets a better description of stellar variability (achieved
        using multi-component models) improves the planetary characterisation. Our
        results are particularly important for the analysis of TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO
        light curves.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Barros, S. C. C.\",\n          \"Demangeon,

        in their compositional and orbital properties. Their bulk densities span a
        large range, from those dense enough to be purely rocky to those needing a
        substantial contribution from volatiles to their volumes. Their orbital configurations
        range from compact, circular multitransiting systems like Kepler-11 to systems
        like our solar system's terrestrial planets with wider spacings and modest
        but significant eccentricities and mutual inclinations. Here we investigate
        whether a continuum of formation conditions resulting from variation in the
        amount of solids available in the inner disk can account for the diversity
        of orbital and compositional properties observed for super-Earths, including
        the apparent dichotomy between single and multitransiting systems. We simulate
        in situ formation of super-Earths via giant impacts and compare to the observed
        Kepler sample. We find that intrinsic variations among disks in the amount
        of solids available for in situ formation can account for the orbital and
        compositional diversity observed among Kepler's transiting planets. Our simulations
        can account for the planets' distributions of orbital period ratios, transit
        duration ratios, and transit multiplicity; higher eccentricities for planets
        in single transiting systems than for those in multitransiting systems; smaller
        eccentricities for larger planets; scatter in the mass-radius relation, including
        lower densities for planets with masses measured with transit timing variations
        instead of with radial velocity; and similarities in planets' sizes and spacings

        in multiplanet systems containing three or more transiting bodies, many of
        which are super-Earths and mini-Neptunes in compact configurations. Using
        N-body simulations, we examine the in situ, final stage assembly of multiplanet
        systems via the collisional accretion of protoplanets. Our initial conditions
        are constructed using a subset of the Kepler five-planet systems as templates.
        Two different prescriptions for treating planetary collisions are adopted.
        The simulations address numerous questions: Do the results depend on the accretion
        prescription?; do the resulting systems resemble the Kepler systems, and do
        they reproduce the observed distribution of planetary multiplicities when
        synthetically observed?; do collisions lead to significant modification of
        protoplanet compositions, or to stripping of gaseous envelopes?; do the eccentricity
        distributions agree with those inferred for the Kepler planets? We find that
        the accretion prescription is unimportant in determining the outcomes. The
        final planetary systems look broadly similar to the Kepler templates adopted,
        but the observed distributions of planetary multiplicities or eccentricities
        are not reproduced, because scattering does not excite the systems sufficiently.
        In addition, we find that \u223C1 per cent of our final systems contain a
        co-orbital planet pair in horseshoe or tadpole orbits. Post-processing the
        collision outcomes suggests that they would not significantly change the ice
        fractions of initially ice-rich protoplanets, but significant stripping of
        gaseous envelopes appears likely. Hence, it may be difficult to reconcile
        the observation that many low-mass Kepler planets have H/He envelopes with
        an in situ formation scenario that involves giant impacts after dispersal
        of the gas disc.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Poon, Sanson T. S.\",\n          \"Nelson,

        \       \"abstract\":\"A rational theory is developed to explain the initial
        pressure rise and consequent separation of a laminar boundary layer when it
        interacts with a moderately strong shock. In this theory, which is firmly
        based on the linearized theory of Lighthill (1953), the region of interest
        is divided into three parts: the major part of the boundary layer, which is
        shown to change under largely inviscid forces, the supersonic main stream
        just adjacent to the boundary layer in which the pressure variation is small;
        and a region close to the wall, on boundary-layer scale, in which the relative
        variation of the velocity is large but is controlled by the incompressible
        boundary-layer equations, together with novel boundary conditions. We find
        that the first two parts can be handled in a straightforward way and the problem
        of self-induced separation reduces, in its essentials, to the solution of
        a single problem in the theory of incompressible boundary layers. It is found
        that this problem has three solutions, one of which corresponds to undisturbed
        flow and another describes a boundary layer which, spontaneously, generates
        an adverse pressure gradient and a decreasing skin friction which eventually
        vanishes and then downstream a reversed flow is set up. The third solution
        generates a favourable pressure gradient and is not relevant to the present
        study. Although there has hitherto been no valid numerical method of integrating
        a boundary layer with reversed flow, we find that an ad hoc method seems to
        lead to a stable solution which has a number of the properties to be expected
        of a separated boundary layer. Comparison with experiment gives qualitatively
        good agreement, but quantitatively errors of the order of 20% are found. It
        is believed that these errors arise because the Reynolds numbers at which
        the experiments were carried out are too small.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Stewartson,

        is the fraction of Kepler stars with transiting super-Earths that also have
        transiting cold Jupiters. This fraction depends on both the probability for
        cold Jupiters to occur in such systems and the mutual orbital inclinations.
        Since the probability of occurrence has already been measured in Doppler surveys,
        we can use the data to constrain the mutual inclination distribution. We find
        \u03C3 = 11.\xB08<SUB>-5.\xB05</SUB> <SUP>+12.\xB07</SUP> (68% confidence)
        and \u03C3 &gt; 3.\xB05 (95% confidence), where \u03C3 is the scale parameter
        of the Rayleigh distribution. This suggests that planetary orbits in systems
        with cold Jupiters tend to be coplanar\u2014although not quite as coplanar
        as those in the solar system, which have a mean inclination from the invariable
        plane of 1.\xB08. We also find evidence that cold Jupiters have lower mutual
        inclinations relative to inner systems with higher transit multiplicity. This
        suggests a link between the dynamical excitation in the inner and outer systems.
        For example, perturbations from misaligned cold Jupiters may dynamically heat
        or destabilize systems of inner super-Earths.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Masuda,

        penetration of a helical magnetic perturbation into a rotating tokamak plasma
        is investigated. In the linear regime, it is found that unless the frequency
        of the imposed perturbation matches closely to one of the natural mode frequencies,
        reconnection at the rational surface is suppressed by a large factor. In order
        to deal with the problem in the nonlinear regime a theory of propagating,
        constant-\u03C8 magnetic islands is developed. This theory is valid provided
        the island width greatly exceeds any microscopic scale length (but still remains
        small compared with the minor radius), and the magnetic Reynolds number of
        the plasma is sufficiently large. An island width evolution equation is obtained
        which, in addition to the usual Rutherford term, contains a stabilizing term
        due ultimately to the inertia of the plasma flow pattern set up around the
        propagating island. A complete solution is presented for the case where the
        island and its associated flow pattern are steady. In the nonlinear regime,
        a fairly sharp threshold is predicted for the magnitude of the applied perturbation.
        Below this threshold, the induced islands are rotationally suppressed and
        partially dragged along by the rotating plasma, and above it the islands are
        virtually fully reconnected and ``locked'' at the applied frequency of the
        perturbation. Numerical results from an initial value code are presented,
        which show good agreement with the analytic predictions. Finally, it is demonstrated
        that these theories can be used to interpret data recently obtained from the
        COMPASS-C device [Controlled Fusion and Plasma Heating 1990 (EPS, Geneva,

        continues to grow following the development of better instruments and missions.
        One key step for the understanding of these worlds is their characterization,
        which mostly depend on their host stars. <BR /> Aims: We perform a significant
        update of the Stars With ExoplanETs CATalog (SWEET-Cat), a unique compilation
        of precise stellar parameters for planet-host stars provided for the exoplanet
        community. <BR /> Methods: We made use of high-resolution spectra for planet-host
        stars, either observed by our team or found in several public archives. The
        new spectroscopic parameters were derived for the spectra following the same
        homogeneous process (ARES+MOOG). The host star parameters were then merged
        together with the planet properties listed in exoplanet.eu to perform simple
        data analysis. <BR /> Results: We present new spectroscopic homogeneous parameters
        for 106 planet-host stars. Sixty-three planet hosts are also reviewed with
        new parameters. We also show that there is a good agreement between stellar
        parameters derived for the same star but using spectra obtained from different
        spectrographs. The planet-metallicity correlation is reviewed showing that
        the metallicity distribution of stars hosting low-mass planets (below 30 M<SUB>\u2295</SUB>)
        is indistinguishable from that from the solar neighborhood sample in terms

        (CIR) is formed when a rotating star emits wind in a non-spherically symmetric
        manner. CIRs have been studied in detail in the solar wind: here, their role
        in stellar winds is considered. The radial distance at which CIRs form (in
        terms of the stellar radius) is proportional to the ratio of wind speed to
        the rotational speed at the stellar surface: in the sun, this ratio is approximately
        200, but it may be much smaller than that in other stars. The properties of
        CIRs appear to be able to account for certain features of 'hybrid stars' (i.e.,
        cool giants with cool winds plus 'warm' lines in their UV spectra), for X-ray
        emitting structures in hot star winds, and for the appearance of extended

        /> Aims: We present a new upgraded version of ARES. The new version includes
        a series of interesting new features such as automatic radial velocity correction,
        a fully automatic continuum determination, and an estimation of the errors
        for the equivalent widths. <BR /> Methods: The automatic correction of the
        radial velocity is achieved with a simple cross-correlation function, and
        the automatic continuum determination, as well as the estimation of the errors,
        relies on a new approach to evaluating the spectral noise at the continuum
        level. <BR /> Results: ARES v2 is totally compatible with its predecessor.
        We show that the fully automatic continuum determination is consistent with
        the previous methods applied for this task. It also presents a significant
        improvement on its performance thanks to the implementation of a parallel

        and electron microscopy have been used to determine the main structural differences

        that forms in dilute alloys of iron, the basic transformation unit takes the
        shape of a lath, and hence the term lath martensite is appropriate for identifying
        this morphology. Each lath is the result of a homogeneous shear, and successive
        shears produce a packet of parallel laths containing a high density of tangled
        dislocations. The other type, plate martensite, differs in the shape taken

        the incredibly diverse variety of astrophysical objects, there are some that
        are characterized by very extreme physical conditions not encountered anywhere
        else in the Universe. Of special interest are ultra-magnetized systems that
        possess magnetic fields exceeding the critical quantum field of about 44 TG.
        There are basically only two classes of such objects: magnetars, whose magnetic
        activity is manifested, e.g., via their very short but intense gamma-ray flares,
        and central engines of supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\u2014the
        most powerful explosions in the modern Universe. Figuring out how these complex
        systems work necessarily requires understanding various plasma processes,
        both small-scale kinetic and large-scale magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), that govern
        their behavior. However, the presence of an ultra-strong magnetic field modifies
        the underlying basic physics to such a great extent that relying on conventional,
        classical plasma physics is often not justified. Instead, plasma-physical
        problems relevant to these extreme astrophysical environments call for constructing
        relativistic quantum plasma (RQP) physics based on quantum electrodynamics
        (QED). In this review, after briefly describing the astrophysical systems
        of interest and identifying some of the key plasma-physical problems important
        to them, we survey the recent progress in the development of such a theory.
        We first discuss the ways in which the presence of a super-critical field
        modifies the properties of vacuum and matter and then outline the basic theoretical
        framework for describing both non-relativistic and RQPs. We then turn to some
        specific astrophysical applications of relativistic QED plasma physics relevant
        to magnetar magnetospheres and to central engines of core-collapse SNe and
        long GRBs. Specifically, we discuss the propagation of light through a magnetar
        magnetosphere; large-scale MHD processes driving magnetar activity and responsible
        for jet launching and propagation in GRBs; energy-transport processes governing
        the thermodynamics of extreme plasma environments; micro-scale kinetic plasma
        processes important in the interaction of intense electric currents flowing
        through a magnetar magnetosphere with the neutron star surface; and magnetic
        reconnection of ultra-strong magnetic fields. Finally, we point out that future
        progress in applying RQP physics to real astrophysical problems will require
        the development of suitable numerical modeling capabilities.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Uzdensky,

        profile for cool stars. It has been implemented in a few transit models to-date
        using numerical integration but there is as-yet no implementation of the power-2
        law in analytic form that is generally available. <BR /> Aims: Our aim is
        to derive an analytic approximation that can be used to quickly and accurately
        calculate light curves of transiting exoplanets using the power-2 limb-darkening
        law. <BR /> Methods: An algorithm to implement the power-2 law is derived
        using a combination of an approximation to the required integral and a Taylor
        expansion of the power-2 law. The accuracy of stellar and planetary radii
        derived by fitting transit light curves with this approximation is tested
        using light curves computed by numerical integration of limb-darkening profiles
        from 3D stellar model atmospheres. <BR /> Results: Our algorithm (qpower2)
        is accurate to about 100 ppm for broad-band optical light curves of systems
        with a star-planet radius ratio p = 0.1. The implementation requires less

        a vortical vector field if the absolute value of the vector is constant as
        for the current distribution in a type-II superconductor in the full critical
        state. Thin samples offer enhanced sensitivity to observe these current discontinuity
        lines magneto-optically due to two facts: The Meissner phase contracts to
        these lines and remains there up to fields, which are higher than the full

        telescope taken in 2000/2001 revealed exceptionally strong and long-lasting

        provided sufficient statistics for a detailed study of the energy spectrum
        between 380 GeV and 8.2 TeV as a function of the flux level. These spectra

        high-temperature copper oxide superconductors has been a matter of long-term
        debate. On quite general grounds, we expect that, owing to their low superfluid
        densities and short correlation lengths, superconducting fluctuations will
        be significant for transport and thermodynamic properties in this part of
        the phase diagram. Although there is ample experimental evidence for such
        correlations, there has been disagreement about how high in temperature they
        may persist, their role in the phenomenology of the pseudogap and their significance
        for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Here we use THz time-domain
        spectroscopy to probe the temporal fluctuations of superconductivity above

        of horizontal and vertical current by propeller cluster current meters and
        temperature by thermistors mounted on a rigid array 8 m high and 20 m long
        moored in the oceanic main thermocline near Bermuda are interpreted in terms
        of thermocline-trapped internal wave modes in the presence of temperature
        and velocity fine structure. The array was deployed roughly 250 m off the
        sloping bottom in water roughly 900 m deep on three occasions. Two-turning-point
        uniformly valid asymptotic solutions to the internal wave equation are developed
        to describe the wave functions. Mode decay beyond the turning point in depth
        or frequency produces a sharp cutoff in vertical current spectra above the
        local buoyancy frequency N(z). An internal wave wave number-frequency spectral
        model E( \u03B1,\u03C9) = E(\u03C9/N<SUB>0</SUB>)<SUP>-2</SUP>(\u03B1/\u03B1<SUB>0</SUB>)<SUP>-2</SUP>
        describes vertical current spectra and ratios of potential energy to horizontal
        kinetic energy. The red wave number shape suppresses peaks in both these quantities
        at frequencies near N(z). A dip in the vertical current spectra at 0.5 cph
        not predicted by the model appears related to the bottom slope. Temperature
        fine structure is modeled as a passive vertical field advected by internal
        waves. Quasi-permanent fine-scale features of the stratification and vertically
        short internal waves are indistinguishable in this study. The model of McKean
        [1974] is generalized to include fine structure fields specified by their
        vertical wave number spectra. In addition to the trapped internal wave model,
        moored temperature spectra, temperature vertical difference spectra, and coherence
        over vertical separations are described by using a fine structure vertical
        wave number spectrum P<SUB>T</SUB>(k) A<SUB>T</SUB>k<SUP>-5/2;</SUP> which
        agrees with other spectra made by using vertical profiling instruments in
        the range 0.1-1.0 cpm. Horizontal current fine structure is also modeled as
        a passive field advected by vertically long internal waves. The model describes
        moored horizontal current spectra (least successfully at frequencies near
        N(z)) and finite difference vertical shear spectra. Contours of temperature
        in depth versus time indicate possible mixing events. These events appear
        concurrently with high shear and Richardson numbers 0.25 \u2272 Ri \u2272
        1.0. Over a 7-m vertical separation a cutoff in Ri at 0.25 is observed, indicating
        possible saturation of the internal wave spectrum. Spectra of finite difference
        approximations to shear and buoyancy frequency are dominated by fine structure
        contributions over nearly the entire internal wave range, suggesting that

        cells in which each cell is updated by certain rules that are dependent on

        automata in cryptography include limited number of reversal rules and inability

        pulsar radio emission is generated in the near magnetosphere of the neutron
        star, and it must propagate through the rest of it to emerge into the interstellar
        medium. An important issue is whether this propagation affects the planes
        of polarization of the generated radiation. Observationally, there is sufficient
        evidence that the emerging radiation is polarized parallel or perpendicular
        to the magnetic field line planes that should be associated with the ordinary
        (O) and extraordinary (X) plasma modes, respectively, excited by some radiative
        process. This strongly suggests that the excited X and O modes are not affected
        by the so-called adiabatic walking that causes a slow rotation of polarization
        vectors. In this paper, we demonstrate that the conditions for adiabatic walking
        are not fulfilled within the soliton model of pulsar radio emission, in which
        the coherent curvature radiation occurs at frequencies much lower than the
        characteristic plasma frequency, The X mode propagates freely and observationally
        represents the primary polarization mode. The O mode has difficulty escaping
        from the pulsar plasma; however, it is sporadically observed as a weaker secondary

        be able to measure the transit time with a precision of about 12s and 34s,

        on the measurement of planetary masses of about 20-30% in a K2-24-like planetary
        system through TTVs. We also simulated the conditions that allow us to detect

        asymmetric multilayers have been used to efficiently manipulate magnetization.
        In a structure with vertical symmetry breaking, a damping-like SOT can deterministically
        switch a perpendicular magnet, provided an in-plane magnetic field is applied.
        Recently, it has been further demonstrated that the in-plane magnetic field
        can be eliminated by introducing a new type of perpendicular field-like SOT
        via incorporating a lateral structural asymmetry into the device. Typically,
        however, when a current is applied to such devices with combined vertical
        and lateral asymmetries, both the perpendicular field-like torque and the
        damping-like torque coexist, hence jointly affecting the magnetization switching
        behavior. Here, we study perpendicular magnetization switching driven by the
        combination of the perpendicular field-like and the damping-like SOTs, which
        exhibits deterministic switching mediated through domain wall propagation.
        It is demonstrated that the role of the damping-like SOT in the deterministic
        switching is highly dependent on the magnetization direction in the domain
        wall. By contrast, the perpendicular field-like SOT is solely determined by
        the relative orientation between the lateral structural asymmetry and the
        current direction, regardless of the magnetization direction in the domain
        wall. The experimental results further the understanding of SOTs-induced switching,

        with a large class of clustering objectives, including prototype or graph

        solutions, our variational multi-term approach enables to control the trade-off
        levels between the fairness and clustering objectives. We derive a general
        tight upper bound based on a concave-convex decomposition of our fairness
        term, its Lipschitz-gradient property and the Pinsker's inequality. Our tight
        upper bound can be jointly optimized with various clustering objectives, while
        yielding a scalable solution, with convergence guarantee. Interestingly, at
        each iteration, it performs an independent update for each assignment variable.
        Therefore, it can be easily distributed for large-scale datasets. This scalability
        is important as it enables to explore different trade-off levels between the

        and PAHA negatively charged at the investigated pH values. The proton binding
        of PAHA and of LSZ is determined by potentiometric proton titrations at various
        KCl concentrations. It is also measured for two mixtures of PAHA-LSZ and compared
        with theoretically calculated proton binding assuming no mutual interaction.
        The charge adaptation due to PAHA-LSZ interaction is relatively small and
        only significant at low and high pH. Next to the proton binding, the mass
        ratio PAHA/LSZ at the iso-electric point (IEP) of the complex at given solution
        conditions is measured together with the pH using the M\xFCtek particle charge
        detector. From the pH changes the charge adaptation due to the interaction
        can be found. Also these measurements show that the net charge adaptation
        is weak for PAHA-LSZ complexes at their IEP. PAHA/LSZ mass ratios in the complexes
        at the IEP are measured at pH 5 and 7. At pH 5 and 50 mmol/L KCl the charge
        of the complex is compensated for 30-40% by K <SUP>+</SUP>; at pH 7, where
        LSZ has a rather low positive charge, this is 45-55%. At pH 5 and 5 mmol/L
        KCl the PAHA/LSZ mass ratio at the IEP of the complex depends on the order
        of addition. When LSZ is added to PAHA about 25% K <SUP>+</SUP> is included
        in the complex, but no K <SUP>+</SUP> is incorporated when PAHA is added to
        LSZ. The flocculation behavior of the complexes is also different. After LSZ
        addition to PAHA slow precipitation occurs (6-24 h) in the IEP, but after
        addition of PAHA to LSZ no precipitation can be seen after 12 h. Clearly,
        PAHA/LSZ complexation and the colloidal stability of PAHA-LSZ aggregates depend

        cyclone (TC) rapid intensification (RI) is difficult to predict and poses
        a formidable threat to coastal populations. A warm upper ocean is well known
        to favor RI, but the role of ocean salinity is less clear. This study shows
        a strong inverse relationship between salinity and TC RI in the eastern Caribbean
        and western tropical Atlantic due to near-surface freshening from the Amazon-Orinoco
        River system. In this region, rapidly intensifying TCs induce a much stronger
        surface enthalpy flux compared to more weakly intensifying storms, in part
        due to a reduction in SST cooling caused by salinity stratification. This
        reduction has a noticeable positive impact on TCs undergoing RI, but the impact
        of salinity on more weakly intensifying storms is insignificant. These statistical
        results are confirmed through experiments with an ocean mixed layer model,
        which show that the salinity-induced reduction in SST cold wakes increases
        significantly as the storm's intensification rate increases. Currently, operational
        statistical-dynamical RI models do not use salinity as a predictor. Through

        recent work, we discuss waves in a warm ideal two-fluid plasma consisting
        of electrons and ions starting from a completely general, ideal two-fluid
        dispersion relation. The plasma is characterized by five variables: the electron
        and ion magnetizations, the squared electron and ion sound speeds, and a parameter
        describing the angle between the propagation vector and the magnetic field.
        The dispersion relation describes six pairs of waves which we label S, A,
        F, M, O, and X. Varying the angle, it is argued that parallel and perpendicular
        propagation (with respect to the magnetic field) exhibit unique behavior.
        This behavior is characterized by the crossing of wave modes which is prohibited
        at oblique angles. We identify up to six different parameter regimes where
        a varying number of exact mode crossings in the special parallel or perpendicular
        orientations can occur. We point out how any ion-electron plasma has a critical
        magnetization (or electron cyclotron frequency) at which the cutoff ordering
        changes, leading to different crossing behaviors. These are relevant for exotic
        plasma conditions found in pulsar and magnetar environments. Our discussion
        is fully consistent with ideal relativistic MHD and contains light waves.
        Additionally, by exploiting the general nature of the dispersion relation,
        phase and group speed diagrams can be computed at arbitrary wavelengths for
        any parameter regime. Finally, we recover earlier approximate dispersion relations
        that focus on low-frequency limits and make direct correspondences with some

        cause a Stop sign to \\\"disappear\\\" according to the detector-either by
        covering thesign with an adversarial Stop sign poster, or by adding adversarial
        stickers onto the sign. In a video recorded in a controlled lab environment,
        the state-of-the-art YOLOv2 detector failed to recognize these adversarial

        The example of a quartic bistable potential is used to illustrate its validity.
        Unlike the conventional exact diagonalization, the SDD method is found to
        be quite efficient for the high eigenstates. We use the eigenfunctions and
        eigenvalues obtained by this method to calculate the propagator, the spectral
        density of the autocorrelation function, and the response of the system to
        a weak periodic driving force for various noise intensities. The asymmetry

        superalloy components. Tensile tests were conducted on specimens welded with
        various combinations of parameters. Room temperature, 760 \xB0C, and 980 \xB0C
        were selected as tensile test temperatures. High-temperature phase transformed,
        during solidification, were identified by differential thermal analysis (DTA).
        The weld-pool shapes and microstructures of welded specimens prepared by various
        welding parameters were evaluated by optical metallography (OM), a scanning
        electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer
        (EDS), and microhardness testing. Results of this study showed that PTA welded
        specimens exhibited 96% nominal tensile strength of IN738LC base materials.
        Specimen failure was observed predominantly in the base materials instead
        of in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) for gas tungsten arc weld (GTAW) repair
        weldments. IN-738LC is considered susceptible to weld cracking during fusion
        welding; however, using a low-input heat repair welding process (PTA), cracking
        susceptibility could be minimized by the optimized welding parameters.\",\n

        word problem (MWP) solving faces a dilemma in number representation learning.
        In order to avoid the number representation issue and reduce the search space
        of feasible solutions, existing works striving for MWP solving usually replace
        real numbers with symbolic placeholders to focus on logic reasoning. However,
        different from common symbolic reasoning tasks like program synthesis and
        knowledge graph reasoning, MWP solving has extra requirements in numerical
        reasoning. In other words, instead of the number value itself, it is the reusable
        numerical property that matters more in numerical reasoning. Therefore, we
        argue that injecting numerical properties into symbolic placeholders with
        contextualized representation learning schema can provide a way out of the
        dilemma in the number representation issue here. In this work, we introduce
        this idea to the popular pre-training language model (PLM) techniques and
        build MWP-BERT, an effective contextual number representation PLM. We demonstrate

        in earth science) are weighted integrals of variograms representing statistically
        homogeneous fields (modes) having mutually uncorrelated increments. Large-
        and small-scale cutoffs were previously assumed proportional to length scales
        of the sampling window and data support. We verify this assumption numerically
        for two-dimensional isotropic fractional Brownian motion (fBm). It was previously
        concluded semi-empirically that, for Hurst coefficient H = 0.25, the constant
        of proportionality is \u03BC = 1/3. We confirm this but find \u03BC to vary
        with mode type and H. We find that due to lack of ergodicity, sample fBm variograms
        generated on finite windows exhibit directional dependence and differ sharply
        between realizations. Many realizations are required to obtain an average
        sample variogram resembling the theoretical power model, especially for persistent
        fields. We propose generating fBm on finite windows using truncated power

        Language Models (MLMs) have shown superior performances in numerous downstream

        significantly worrying levels of social biases. We show that the previously
        proposed evaluation metrics for quantifying the social biases in MLMs are
        problematic due to following reasons: (1) prediction accuracy of the masked
        tokens itself tend to be low in some MLMs, which raises questions regarding
        the reliability of the evaluation metrics that use the (pseudo) likelihood
        of the predicted tokens, and (2) the correlation between the prediction accuracy
        of the mask and the performance in downstream NLP tasks is not taken into
        consideration, and (3) high frequency words in the training data are masked
        more often, introducing noise due to this selection bias in the test cases.
        To overcome the above-mentioned disfluencies, we propose All Unmasked Likelihood
        (AUL), a bias evaluation measure that predicts all tokens in a test case given
        the MLM embedding of the unmasked input. We find that AUL accurately detects
        different types of biases in MLMs. We also propose AUL with attention weights

        paper we prove the spectral theorem for quaternionic unbounded normal operators
        using the notion of S-spectrum. The proof technique consists of first establishing
        a spectral theorem for quaternionic bounded normal operators and then using
        a transformation which maps a quaternionic unbounded normal operator to a
        quaternionic bounded normal operator. With this paper we complete the foundation
        of spectral analysis of quaternionic operators. The S-spectrum has been introduced
        to define the quaternionic functional calculus but it turns out to be the
        correct object also for the spectral theorem for quaternionic normal operators.
        The lack of a suitable notion of spectrum was a major obstruction to fully
        understand the spectral theorem for quaternionic normal operators. A prime
        motivation for studying the spectral theorem for quaternionic unbounded normal

        Through the introduction of additive particles into the dielectric, results

        produced in dielectric without additive. These craters also possess a noticeable

        stress was produced than that of highest concentration, i.e. 80 mg L<SUP>-1</SUP>.
        The increased amounts of oxidative stress reflect a higher amount of ROS production

        to interfere with the calcium and phosphorus absorption pathway. Besides all

        general model of a hybrid interfacial domain wall (HIDW) in ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic
        exchange biased bilayers is proposed, where an interfacial domain wall is
        allowed to extend into either the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic layer
        or across both. The proposition is based on our theoretical investigation
        on thickness and field dependences of ferromagnetic domain wall (FMDW) and
        antiferromagnetic domain wall (AFDW), respectively. Good match of the simulation
        to the hysteresis loops of a series of NiFe/FeMn exchange-biased bilayers
        confirms the existence of the HIDW, where the AFDW part is found to preferentially
        occupy the entire antiferromagnetic layer while the FMDW shrinks with the
        increased magnetic field as expected. The observed asymmetry between the ascending
        and descending branches of the hysteresis loop is explained naturally as a
        consequence of different partition ratios between AFDW and FMDW. <P />Project

        First, we clarify the relation of our model to that of rigid active particles.
        Then, we study the dynamical modes that active deformable particles exhibit
        by changing the strength of the external flow. We emphasize the difference

        difficulty of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation comes from the semiclassical problem

        the original one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation into a modified equation.
        The adaptive grids are constructed through the interpolating wavelet method.

        grids to solve the modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation, where the approximation
        to the second-order derivative is given by the Lagrange interpolation method.
        At last, the numerical results are given. It is shown that the obtained time-splitting

        markets with producers and customers of goods and services. There have been
        concerns that over-emphasis on customer satisfaction by the platforms may
        affect the well-being of the producers. To counter such issues, few recent
        works have attempted to incorporate fairness for the producers. However, these
        studies have overlooked an important issue in such platforms -- to supposedly
        improve customer utility, the underlying algorithms are frequently updated,
        causing abrupt changes in the exposure of producers. In this work, we focus
        on the fairness issues arising out of such frequent updates, and argue for
        incremental updates of the platform algorithms so that the producers have
        enough time to adjust (both logistically and mentally) to the change. However,
        naive incremental updates may become unfair to the customers. Thus focusing
        on recommendations deployed on two-sided platforms, we formulate an ILP based
        online optimization to deploy changes incrementally in n steps, where we can
        ensure smooth transition of the exposure of items while guaranteeing a minimum
        utility for every customer. Evaluations over multiple real world datasets

        dissolution of tungsten carbide-cobalt alloy (WC-Co) micro-tools for micromachining
        operations with an eco-friendly electrolyte. One of the essential factors
        in efficient anodic dissolution is the selection of appropriate electrolytes.
        Sulphuric acid (H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>) is extensively used in the electrochemical
        process to dissolve WC-Co due to its higher dissolution rate and efficiency.
        But toxicity of H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>, even at moderate concentration,
        poses a significant threat to the operator and the environment. Hence in this
        investigation, an eco-friendly electrolyte has been proposed which is a combination
        of sodium nitrate (NaNO<SUB>3</SUB>) and a complexing agent citric acid (C<SUB>6</SUB>H<SUB>8</SUB>O<SUB>7</SUB>),
        that not only gives a higher dissolution rate of WC-Co but also gives similar
        dissolution efficiency that of H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>. A detailed experimentation
        to optimize the concentration of complexing agent in the eco- friendly electrolyte
        was carried out through micro wire-electrochemical machining (micro-WECM)
        and was analyzed using yield parameters, topographical and material surface
        analysis as well as electrochemical analysis. This eco-friendly electrolyte
        produces higher dissolution rate and better surface finish in different levels
        of parameters in comparison to H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>. Potentiodynamic
        polarization test through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) showed maximum current

        binding of cadmium at the competitive site of dopamine on DA-D2 receptors.
        Treatment with quercetin resulted in the alleviation of cadmium-induced behavioral
        and neurochemical alterations. This is the first report demonstrating that
        cadmium-induced motor deficits are associated with alteration in postsynaptic
        dopaminergic signaling due to a decrease in DA-D2 receptors in the corpus
        striatum. The results further demonstrate that quercetin has the potential

        scheme toward multi-time scale modeling, which we refer to as \u2018Practical
        Time Averaging' (PTA), to molecular dynamical (MD) systems. In the first part,
        we investigate the fine-scale dynamics of a one-dimensional chain of identical
        particles under cyclic loading. Assuming a double-well interatomic potential
        among adjacent particles leads to a phase transition between two distinct
        equilibrium states. Specifically, we study the macroscopic stress-strain behavior
        of the dynamical chain in three settings, i.e. Newtonian MD, Newtonian MD
        with viscous dissipation and Newtonian MD with thermostat. Rate-independent
        high frequency oscillations are observed in Newtonian MD due to an instability
        that is related to the non-convexity of the strain energy. This is stabilized
        by adding viscosity or a thermostat, which leads to strong hysteresis that
        is consistent with quasi-static results (i.e. lattice statics). In the second
        part, we first define coarse variables as finite time averages of phase functions
        in MD. Then we apply the technique of PTA developed in Tan et al. (2013) to
        numerically approximate the coarse dynamics for the time averaged quantities.
        The tested model problems include a two-dimensional lattice made of stoichiometric
        Nickel-Manganese undergoing detwinning and a three-dimensional atomic chain
        made of face-centered cubic (FCC) Nickel under uniaxial tension. The macroscopic
        features (such as space-time averaged strain/stress) are obtained from coarse

        present the open source Astrophysical Multi-purpose Software Environment (AMUSE),
        a component library for performing astrophysical simulations involving different
        physical domains and scales. It couples existing codes within a Python framework
        based on a communication layer using MPI. The interfaces are standardized
        for each domain and their implementation based on MPI guarantees that the
        whole framework is well-suited for distributed computation. It includes facilities
        for unit handling and data storage. Currently it includes codes for gravitational
        dynamics, stellar evolution, hydrodynamics and radiative transfer. Within
        each domain the interfaces to the codes are as similar as possible. We describe
        the design and implementation of AMUSE, as well as the main components and
        community codes currently supported and we discuss the code interactions facilitated
        by the framework. Additionally, we demonstrate how AMUSE can be used to resolve

        discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel
        TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method,
        and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation
        of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation,
        while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces
        are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally
        be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces
        are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined
        with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme
        where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps.
        Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain
        decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling
        curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend
        on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption
        and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first
        cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10<SUP>10</SUP> dark matter
        particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10<SUP>5</SUP>

        very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling
        and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million.

        A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the
        numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution
        scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced
        evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition
        equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated
        timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP.
        State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction
        rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module
        is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined
        public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples
        indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed
        and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These
        examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs,
        and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of
        a 1 M <SUB>sun</SUB> star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white

        asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating
        B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars
        from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing

        recently the gravitational N-body problem has been modelled numerically either
        by direct integration, in which the computation needed increases as N<SUP>2</SUP>,
        or by an iterative potential method in which the number of operations grows
        as N log N. Here we describe a novel method of directly calculating the force
        on N bodies that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured
        hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively
        divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy
        the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding

        In this TREESPH code, hydrodynamic properties are determined using a Monte
        Carlo-like approach known as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Unlike
        most previous implementations of SPH, gravitational forces are computed with

        introduction of a grid. A unification of SPH with the hierarchical tree method

        of low mass stars from the main sequence to the helium flash. Many such computations
        are handicapped by the fact that the hydrogen burning shell source becomes
        very thin at a relatively early stage of evolution, and this means that either
        a very short time step is needed on the red giant branch, or else that some
        special method must be introduced. The present method has neither handicap:
        the same procedure is used whether there is a thin shell or not, and the time
        step can be chosen so that the overall structure of the star changes by a
        fixed small amount per step. About 100 or 150 steps are necessary to evolve
        a star to the helium flash. The basic features of the method are that the
        structure equations are solved using a non-Lagrangian mesh, so that a thin
        shell if it exists can move slowly through the mesh, even if it moves rapidly
        with respect to the mass coordinate; and that the composition and the mesh
        are solved simultaneously with the structure equations, giving greater stability
        and self-consistency. Although the work described here does not take account
        of convective mixing of composition, it is suggested that a simple generalization

        of a `circumbinary planet' orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitively
        established until the discovery of the planet transiting (that is, passing
        in front of) Kepler-16. Questions remained, however, about the prevalence
        of circumbinary planets and their range of orbital and physical properties.
        Here we report two additional transiting circumbinary planets: Kepler-34 (AB)b
        and Kepler-35 (AB)b, referred to here as Kepler-34 b and Kepler-35 b, respectively.
        Each is a low-density gas-giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that

        whereas Kepler-35 b orbits a pair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the Sun's
        mass) every 131 days. The planets experience large multi-periodic variations

        half or more of the mass of a virialized system is lost in less than one dynamical
        crossing time, the system dissociates. If the mass loss occurs in a collapsing
        protosystem with uniform density, no angular momentum, and relatively little
        radiation of energy, the minimum fractional mass loss required for dissociation
        is reduced to \u0394M/M<SUB>0</SUB> = R<SUB>c</SUB>/(2R<SUB>0</SUB>). Here
        R<SUB>c</SUB> is the radius of the system when the mass loss occurs and R<SUB>0</SUB>
        is the radius it would have attained after virialization if no mass loss had
        occurred. A situation of this type is expected in a protocluster that forms
        from a collapsing interstellar cloud. The stars form when the protocluster
        is near its point of maximum compression. Any newly formed OB stars produce
        an H II region whose expansion dissipates the residual gas in the protocluster
        before the system reaches dynamical equilibrium. The angular momentum of the
        protosystem and any radiative losses from it prior to star formation will
        tend to stabilize it against mass loss by limiting the compression factor
        2R<SUB>0</SUB>/R<SUB>c</SUB>. The angular momentum places a lower limit on
        the radius R<SUB>c</SUB>, and the radiative losses reduce the final equilibrium
        radius R0. However, observed infantile clusters such as the Trapezium are
        sufficiently compressed at the present time that a loss of as little as 10%
        of their mass is sufficient to dissociate them. This may explain why most
        young stars are not located in gravitationally bound clusters. If the protocluster
        gas contains an appreciable magnetic field, the compression of this field
        in the collapsing cloud drains off some of the gravitational energy that otherwise
        would go into the kinetic energy of collapse. This increases the minimum mass
        loss required to dissociate the system, but it is still very small for most
        systems. The mean terminal expansion velocity of an association produced by
        the breakup of a protocluster is usually comparable to the velocity dispersion

        clouds account for half of the mass of the interstellar medium interior to
        the solar circle and for all current star formation. Using cloud catalogs
        of two CO surveys of the first quadrant, we have fitted the mass distribution
        of molecular clouds to a truncated power law in a similar manner as the luminosity
        function of OB associations in the companion paper to this work. After extrapolating
        from the first quadrant to the entire inner Galaxy, we find that the mass
        of cataloged clouds amounts to only 40% of current estimates of the total
        Galactic molecular mass. Following Solomon &amp; Rivolo, we have assumed that
        the remaining molecular gas is in cold clouds, and we normalize the distribution
        accordingly. The predicted total number of clouds is then shown to be consistent
        with that observed in the solar neighborhood where cloud catalogs should be
        more complete. Within the solar circle, the cumulative form of the distribution
        is \\\\Nscr<SUB>c</SUB>(&gt;M)=105[(M<SUB>u</SUB>/M)<SUP>0.6</SUP>-1], where
        \\\\Nscr<SUB>c</SUB> is the number of clouds, and M<SUB>u</SUB> = 6 \xD7 10<SUP>6</SUP>
        M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> is the upper mass limit. The large number of clouds near
        the upper cutoff to the distribution indicates an underlying physical limit
        to cloud formation or destruction processes. The slope of the distribution
        corresponds to d\\\\Nscr<SUB>c</SUB>/dM~M<SUP>-1.6</SUP>, implying that although
        numerically most clouds are of low mass, most of the molecular gas is contained
        within the most massive clouds. <P />The distribution of cloud masses is then
        compared to the Galactic distribution of OB association luminosities to obtain
        statistical estimates of the number of massive stars expected in any given
        cloud. The likelihood of massive star formation in a cloud is determined,
        and it is found that the median cloud mass that contains at least one O star
        is ~10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. The average star formation efficiency
        over the lifetime of an association is about 5% but varies by more than 2
        orders of magnitude from cloud to cloud and is predicted to increase with
        cloud mass. O stars photoevaporate their surrounding molecular gas, and even
        with low rates of formation, they are the principal agents of cloud destruction.
        Using an improved estimate of the timescale for photoevaporation and our statistics
        on the expected numbers of stars per cloud, we find that 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>
        giant molecular clouds (GMCs) are expected to survive for about 3 \xD7 10<SUP>7</SUP>
        yr. Smaller clouds are disrupted, rather than photoionized, by photoevaporation.
        The porosity of H II regions in large GMCs is shown to be of order unity,
        which is consistent with self-regulation of massive star formation in GMCs.

        most stars, and probably all massive stars, are born in dense stellar clusters.
        The mechanism by which a molecular cloud fragments to form several hundred
        to thousands of individual stars has remained elusive. Here, we use a numerical
        simulation to follow the fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud, and
        the subsequent formation and early evolution of a stellar cluster containing
        more than 400 stars. We show that the stellar cluster forms through the hierarchical
        fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud. This leads to the formation
        of many small subclusters, which interact and merge to form the final stellar
        cluster. The hierarchical nature of the cluster formation has serious implications
        in terms of the properties of the new-born stars. The higher number-density
        of stars in subclusters, compared to a more uniform distribution arising from
        a monolithic formation, results in closer and more frequent dynamical interactions.
        Such close interactions can truncate circumstellar discs, harden existing
        binaries and potentially liberate a population of planets. We estimate that
        at least one-third of all stars, and most massive stars, suffer such disruptive

        into account. Initial conditions are chosen to represent relatively young
        Galactic open clusters, such as the Pleiades, Praesepe and the Hyades. The
        calculations include a realistic mass function, primordial binaries and the
        external potential of the parent Galaxy. Our model clusters are generally
        significantly flattened by the Galactic tidal field, and dissolve before deep
        core collapse occurs. The binary fraction decreases initially because of the
        destruction of soft binaries, but increases later because lower mass single
        stars escape more easily than the more massive binaries. At late times, the
        cluster core is quite rich in giants and white dwarfs. There is no evidence
        for preferential evaporation of old white dwarfs. On the contrary, the white
        dwarfs formed are likely to remain in the cluster. Stars tend to escape from
        the cluster through the first and second Lagrange points, in the direction
        of and away from the Galactic Centre. Mass segregation manifests itself in
        our models well within an initial relaxation time. As expected, giants and
        white dwarfs are much more strongly affected by mass segregation than main-sequence
        stars. Open clusters are dynamically rather inactive. However, the combined
        effects of stellar mass-loss and evaporation of stars from the cluster potential
        drive the dissolution of a cluster on a much shorter time-scale than if these
        effects are neglected. The often-used argument that a star cluster is barely
        older than its relaxation time and therefore cannot be dynamically evolved
        is clearly in error for the majority of star clusters. An observation of a
        blue straggler in an eccentric orbit around an unevolved star or a blue straggler

        grows steadily in mass through mergers with other stars, forming a very massive
        ( &gt;100M_sun) star in less than 3-4 Myr. The growth rate of this runaway
        merger is much larger than estimates based on simple cross-section arguments,

        with other massive stars there. The runaway is ``rejuvenated'' by each new

        for speeding up the code NBODY6 which is widely used for direct N-body simulations.
        Over the years, the N<SUP>2</SUP> nature of the direct force calculation has
        proved a barrier for extending the particle number. Following an early introduction
        of force polynomials and individual time steps, the calculation cost was first
        reduced by the introduction of a neighbour scheme. After a decade of GRAPE
        computers which speeded up the force calculation further, we are now in the
        era of GPUs where relatively small hardware systems are highly cost effective.
        A significant gain in efficiency is achieved by employing the GPU to obtain
        the so-called regular force which typically involves some 99 per cent of the
        particles, while the remaining local forces are evaluated on the host. However,
        the latter operation is performed up to 20 times more frequently and may still
        account for a significant cost. This effort is reduced by parallel SSE/AVX
        procedures where each interaction term is calculated using mainly single precision.
        We also discuss further strategies connected with coordinate and velocity
        prediction required by the integration scheme. This leaves hard binaries and

        the cores of young dense star clusters, repeated stellar collisions involving
        the same object can occur. It has been suggested that this leads to the formation
        of an intermediate-mass black hole. To verify this scenario we compute the
        detailed evolution of the merger remnant of three sequences, then follow the
        evolution until the onset of carbon burning, and estimate the final remnant
        mass to determine the ultimate fate of a runaway merger sequence. We use a
        detailed stellar evolution code to follow the evolution of the collision product.
        At each collision we mix the two colliding stars, accounting for the mass
        loss during the collision. During the stellar evolution we apply mass-loss
        rates from the literature, as appropriate for the evolutionary stage of the
        merger remnant. We computed models for high (Z = 0.02) and low (Z = 0.001)
        metallicity to quantify metallicity effects. We find that the merger remnant
        becomes a Wolf-Rayet star before the end of core hydrogen burning. Mass loss
        from stellar winds dominates the mass increase due to repeated mergers for
        all three merger sequences that we consider. In none of our high-metallicity
        models an intermediate-mass black hole is formed, instead our models have
        a mass of 10-14 {M}_\u2299 at the onset of carbon burning. For low metallicity
        the final remnant is more massive and may explode as a pair-creation supernova.
        We find that our metal-rich models become inflated as a result of developing
        an extended low-density envelope. This may increase the probability of further
        collisions, but self-consistent N-body calculations with detailed evolution

        data and theoretical constraints. By way of example, we construct a chain
        of 10<SUP>5</SUP> models for the Milky Way designed to fit a wide range of
        photometric and kinematic observations. From this chain, we calculate the

        while heating of the gas is provided by the far-ultraviolet flux of all stars.
        Stars are allowed to form from the gas according to a Jeans instability criterion:
        gas is unstable when the Jeans mass is smaller than a critical mass, and stars
        form as soon as the gas remains unstable longer than the collapse time. With
        these ingredients we are able to create a two-phase interstellar medium and
        our model gives realistic star formation rates (SFRs). We investigate the
        influence of free parameters on the star formation. In order of decreasing
        importance these are: ionization fraction of the gas (determines the cooling
        properties), initial mass function (controls the heat input for the gas),
        collapse time for molecular clouds, and star formation efficiency. In the
        simulations the star formation quickly settles a kind of thermal equilibrium
        of the ISM. This result strongly favours the self-regulating mechanism for
        star formation. The model yields a Schmidt law power dependence of the SFR
        on gas density (SFR{prop.to}\u03C1^n^) with index n=~1.3, in good agreement
        with observations. The simulations show that star formation can only occur

        100K. The gas above the plane and outside approximately 6 radial scale lengths
        is always warm (T&gt;8000K), heated by the stellar photons. It suggests that
        radial truncation of stellar disks is a thermal rather than a dynamical process.

        developed a new direct-tree hybrid N-body algorithm for fully self-consistent
        N-body simulations of star clusters in their parent galaxies. In such simulations,
        star clusters need high accuracy, while galaxies need a fast scheme because
        of the large number of particles required to model it. In our new algorithm,
        the internal motion of the star cluster is calculated accurately using the
        direct Hermite scheme with individual timesteps, and all other motions are
        calculated using the tree code with a second-order leapfrog integrator. The
        direct and tree schemes are combined using an extension of the mixed variable
        symplectic (MVS) scheme. Thus, the Hamiltonian corresponding to everything
        other than the internal motion of the star cluster is integrated with the
        leapfrog, which is symplectic. Using this algorithm, we performed fully self-consistent
        N-body simulations of star clusters in their parent galaxy. The internal and
        orbital evolutions of the star cluster agreed well with those obtained using
        the direct scheme. We also performed fully self-consistent N-body simulation
        for large-N models (N = 2 \xD7 10<SUP>6</SUP>). In this case, the calculation
        speed was seven-times faster than what would be if the direct scheme was used.\",\n

        photometric time-series data, collected for the purpose of finding a small
        number of rare sources, such as transiting extrasolar planets and gravitational
        microlenses. Once combed, these data are often set aside, and are not further
        searched for the many other variable sources that they undoubtedly contain.
        To this end, we describe a pipeline that is designed to systematically analyze
        such data, while requiring minimal user interaction. We ran our pipeline on
        a subset of the Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey dataset, and used it to identify
        and model 773 eclipsing binary systems. For each system we conducted a joint
        analysis of its light curve, colors, and theoretical isochrones. This analysis
        provided us with estimates of the binary's absolute physical properties, including
        the masses and ages of their stellar components, as well as their physical
        separations and distances. We identified three types of eclipsing binaries
        that are of particular interest and merit further observations. The first
        category includes 11 low-mass candidates, which may assist current efforts
        to explain the discrepancies between the observation and the models of stars
        at the bottom of the main sequence. The other two categories include 34 binaries
        with eccentric orbits, and 20 binaries with abnormal light curves. Finally,
        this uniform catalog enabled us to identify a number of relations that provide

        gas are coupled self-consistently to allow the realistic dynamical evolution

        code keeps track of the changes in stellar mass, luminosity and radius. The
        gas liberated by the stellar winds and supernovae deposits mass and energy
        into the gas reservoir in which the cluster is embedded. We examine cluster
        models with 1000 stars, but we varied the star formation efficiency (between
        0.05 and 0.5), cluster radius (0.1-1.0 pc), the degree of virial support of
        the initial population of stars (0-100 per cent) and the strength of the feedback.
        We find that an initial star fraction M<SUB>\u2605</SUB>/M<SUB>tot</SUB> &gt;

        models are more luminous than normal stars of the same mass and in the same
        stage of evolution, but cooler than homogeneously mixed versions of the collision
        products. The increased luminosity and inefficient mixing decrease the remaining

        dominated by close interactions between stars, and physical collisions between
        stars may occur quite frequently. Simulating a stellar collision event can
        be an intensive numerical task, as detailed calculations of this process require
        hydrodynamic simulations in three dimensions. We present a computationally
        inexpensive method in which we approximate the merger process, including shock
        heating, hydrodynamic mixing and mass loss, with a simple algorithm based
        on conservation laws and a basic qualitative understanding of the hydrodynamics
        of stellar mergers. The algorithm relies on Archimedes' principle to dictate
        the distribution of the fluid in the stable equilibrium situation. We calibrate
        and apply the method to mergers of massive stars, as these are expected to
        occur in young and dense star clusters. We find that without the effects of
        microscopic mixing, the temperature and chemical composition profiles in a
        collision product can become double-valued functions of enclosed mass. Such
        an unphysical situation is mended by simulating microscopic mixing as a post-collision
        effect. In this way we find that head-on collisions between stars of the same
        spectral type result in substantial mixing, while mergers between stars of
        different spectral type, such as type B and O stars (~10 and ~40M<SUB>solar</SUB>

        The SPH nature of SPHRAY makes the incorporation of separate hydrodynamics
        and gravity solvers very natural. SPHRAY relies on a Monte Carlo (MC) ray-tracing
        scheme that does not interpolate the SPH particles on to a grid but instead
        integrates directly through the SPH kernels. Given an arbitrary (series of)
        SPH density field(s) and a description of the sources of ionizing radiation,
        the code will calculate the non-equilibrium ionization and temperature state

        can include point-like objects, diffuse recombination radiation, and a background
        field from outside the computational volume. The MC ray-tracing implementation
        allows for the quick introduction of new physics and is parallelization-friendly.

        ~= 0.44) orbit. The standard model for producing MSPs fails to explain the
        orbital characteristics of this extraordinary binary, and alternative binary
        models are unable to explain the observables. We present a triple-star model
        for producing MSPs in relatively wide eccentric binaries with a normal (main-sequence)
        stellar companion. We start from a stable triple system consisting of a low-mass
        X-ray binary (LMXB) with an orbital period of at least 1 day, accompanied
        by a G dwarf in a wide and possibly eccentric orbit. Variations in the initial
        conditions naturally provide a satisfactory explanation for the unexplained
        triple component in the eclipsing soft X-ray transient 4U 2129+47 or the cataclysmic
        variable EC 19314-5915. The best explanation for J1903+0327, however, results
        from the expansion of the orbit of the LMXB, driven by the mass transfer from
        the evolving donor star to its neutron star companion, which causes the triple
        eventually to become dynamically unstable. Using numerical computations we
        show that, depending on the precise system configuration at the moment the
        triple becomes dynamically unstable, the ejection of each of the three components
        is possible. If the donor star of the LMXB is ejected, a system resembling
        J1903+0327 will result. If the neutron star is ejected, a single MSP results.
        This model therefore also provides a straightforward mechanism for forming
        a single MSP in the Galactic disk. We conclude that the Galaxy contains some
        30-300 binaries with characteristics similar to J1903+0327 and about an order

        We conclude, based on our simulations, that the orbits of the observed Kepler

        results from the binary driving. This mediates planet formation either through

        that the eccentricity of supermassive black hole (SMBH)-intermediate black
        hole (IMBH) binaries grows toward unity through interactions with the stellar
        background. This increase of eccentricity reduces the merging timescale of
        the binary through the gravitational radiation to a value well below the Hubble
        time. It also gives a theoretical explanation of the existence of eccentric
        binaries such as that in OJ287. In self-consistent N-body simulations, this
        increase of eccentricity is always observed. On the other hand, the result
        of the scattering experiment between SMBH binaries and field stars indicated
        that the eccentricity dose not change significantly. This discrepancy leaves
        the high eccentricity of the SMBH binaries in N-body simulations unexplained.
        Here, we present a stellar-dynamical mechanism that drives the increase of
        the eccentricity of an SMBH binary with a large mass ratio. There are two
        key processes involved. The first one is the Kozai mechanism under a non-axisymmetric
        potential, which effectively randomizes the angular momenta of surrounding
        stars. The other is the selective ejection of stars with prograde orbits.
        Through these two mechanisms, field stars extract the orbital angular momentum
        of the SMBH binary. Our proposed mechanism causes the increase in the eccentricity

        fractions of the dense circumnuclear gas have high kinetic temperatures, which
        are hard to explain by pure photon excitation, but may be caused by dissipation
        of turbulent energy. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine to what extent mechanical
        heating should be taken into account while modeling PDRs. To this end, the
        effect of dissipated turbulence on the thermal and chemical properties of
        PDRs is explored. <BR /> Methods: Clouds are modeled as 1D semi-infinite slabs
        whose thermal and chemical equilibrium is solved for using the Leiden PDR-XDR
        code, where mechanical heating is added as a constant term throughout the
        cloud. An extensive parameter space in hydrogen gas density, FUV radiation
        field and mechanical heating rate is considered, covering almost all possible
        cases for the ISM relevant to the conditions that are encountered in galaxies.
        Effects of mechanical heating on the temperature profiles, column densities
        of CO and H<SUB>2</SUB>O and column density ratios of HNC, HCN and HCO<SUP>+</SUP>
        are discussed. <BR /> Results: In a steady-state treatment, mechanical heating
        seems to play an important role in determining the kinetic temperature of
        the gas in molecular clouds. Particularly in high-energy environments such
        as starburst galaxies and galaxy centers, model gas temperatures are underestimated
        by at least a factor of two if mechanical heating is ignored. The models also
        show that CO, HCN and H<SUB>2</SUB>O column densities increase as a function
        of mechanical heating. The HNC/HCN integrated column density ratio shows a
        decrease by a factor of at least two in high density regions with n ~ 10<SUP>5</SUP>

        on mechanical heating for this same density range, with boosts of up to three
        orders of magnitude. <BR /> Conclusions: The effects of mechanical heating
        cannot be ignored in studies of the molecular gas excitation whenever the
        ratio of the star formation rate to the gas density (SFR/n<SUP>3/2</SUP>)

        present a simple and efficient method to set up spherical structure models
        for N-body simulations with a multimass technique. This technique reduces
        by a substantial factor the computer run time needed in order to resolve a
        given scale as compared to single-mass models. It therefore allows to resolve
        smaller scales in N-body simulations for a given computer run time. Here,
        we present several models with an effective resolution of up to 1.68 \xD7
        10<SUP>9</SUP> particles within their virial radius which are stable over
        cosmologically relevant time-scales. As an application, we confirm the theoretical
        prediction by Dehnen that in mergers of collisionless structures like dark
        matter haloes always the cusp of the steepest progenitor is preserved. We
        model each merger progenitor with an effective number of particles of approximately
        10<SUP>8</SUP> particles. We also find that in a core-core merger the central
        density approximately doubles whereas in the cusp-cusp case the central density
        only increases by approximately 50 per cent. This may suggest that the central
        regions of flat structures are better protected and get less energy input
        through the merger process.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Zemp, Marcel\",\n          \"Moore,

        method for radiative transfer on an unstructured Delaunay grid. The grid samples
        the medium through which photons are transported in an optimal way for fast
        radiative transfer calculations. <BR /> Aims: We study the detailed working
        of SimpleX in test problems and show improvements over the previous version
        of the method. <BR /> Methods: We have applied a direction conserving transport
        scheme that correctly transports photons in the optically thin regime, a regime
        where the original SimpleX algorithm lost its accuracy. In addition, a scheme
        of dynamic grid updates is employed to ensure correct photon transport when
        the optical depth changes during a simulation. For the application to large
        data sets, the method is parallellised for distributed memory machines using
        MPI. <BR /> Results: To test the new method, we have performed standard tests
        for cosmological radiative transfer. We show excellent correspondence with
        both the analytical solution (when available) and to the results of other
        codes compared to the former version of SimpleX, without sacrificing the benefits
        of the high computational speed of the method.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Paardekooper,

        clusters, we present a statistical analysis of the currently observed Pleiades.
        Starting with a photometric catalog of the cluster, we employ a maximum likelihood
        technique to determine the mass distribution of its members, including single
        stars and both components of binary systems. We find that the overall binary
        fraction for unresolved pairs is 68%. Extrapolating to include resolved systems,
        this fraction climbs to about 76%, significantly higher than the accepted
        field star result. Both figures are sensitive to the cluster age, for which
        we have used the currently favored value of 125 Myr. The primary and secondary
        masses within binaries are correlated, in the sense that their ratios are
        closer to unity than under the hypothesis of random pairing. We map out the
        spatial variation of the cluster's projected and three-dimensional mass and
        number densities. Finally, we revisit the issue of mass segregation in the
        Pleiades. We find unambiguous evidence of segregation, and introduce a new
        method for quantifying it.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Converse, Joseph M.\",\n

        and multiphysics applications are now commonplace, and many researchers focus
        on combining existing models to construct combined multiscale models. Here
        we present a concise review of multiscale applications and their source communities.
        We investigate the prevalence of multiscale projects in the EU and the US,
        review a range of coupling toolkits they use to construct multiscale models
        and identify areas where collaboration between disciplines could be particularly
        beneficial. We conclude that multiscale computing has become increasingly
        popular in recent years, that different communities adopt very different approaches
        to constructing multiscale simulations, and that simulations on a length scale
        of a few metres and a time scale of a few hours can be found in many of the
        multiscale research domains. Communities may receive additional benefit from
        sharing methods that are geared towards these scales.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Groen,

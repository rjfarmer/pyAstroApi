        next Galactic supernova is expected to bring great opportunities for the direct
        detection of gravitational waves (GW), full flavour neutrinos, and multiwavelength
        photons. To maximize the science return from such a rare event, it is essential
        to have established classes of possible situations and preparations for appropriate
        observations. To this end, we use a long-term numerical simulation of the
        core-collapse supernova (CCSN) of a 17 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> red supergiant progenitor
        to self-consistently model the multimessenger signals expected in GW, neutrino,
        and electromagnetic messengers. This supernova model takes into account the
        formation and evolution of a protoneutron star, neutrino-matter interaction,
        and neutrino transport, all within a two-dimensional shock hydrodynamics simulation.
        With this, we separately discuss three situations: (I) a CCSN at the Galactic
        Center, (II) an extremely nearby CCSN within hundreds of parsecs, and (III)
        a CCSN in nearby galaxies within several Mpc. These distance regimes necessitate
        different strategies for synergistic observations. In a Galactic CCSN, neutrinos
        provide strategic timing and pointing information. We explore how these in
        turn deliver an improvement in the sensitivity of GW analyses and help to
        guarantee observations of early electromagnetic signals. To facilitate the
        detection of multimessenger signals of CCSNe in extremely nearby and extragalactic
        distances, we compile a list of nearby red supergiant candidates and a list
        of nearby galaxies with their expected CCSN rates. By exploring the sequential
        multimessenger signals of a nearby CCSN, we discuss preparations for maximizing
        successful studies of such an unprecedented stirring event.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Nakamura,

        Expecting that the capability to detect electron-type neutrinos ({\u03BD }<SUB>e</SUB>)
        will increase dramatically with the emergence of liquid-argon detectors such
        as DUNE, we broaden the scope in this study to include all flavors of neutrinos
        emitted from the pre-bounce phase. We pick up three progenitor models of electron
        capture supernovae (ECSNe) and iron-core collapse supernovae (FeCCSNe). We
        find that the number luminosities reach \u223C10<SUP>57</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>

        flavor oscillations into account and assuming the distance to the progenitors
        to be 200 pc. It is demonstrated that {\\\\bar{\u03BD }}<SUB>e</SUB> from
        the ECSN progenitor will be undetected at almost all detectors, whereas we
        will be able to observe \u227315,900 {\u03BD }<SUB>e</SUB> at DUNE for the

        depending on the mass hierarchy, whereas the number of {\u03BD }<SUB>e</SUB>

        Our new approach to locating convective boundaries is consistent with the
        physics of convection, and yields reliable values of the convective-core mass
        during both hydrogen- and helium-burning phases. Stars with M&lt; 8 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>
        become white dwarfs and cool to the point where the electrons are degenerate
        and the ions are strongly coupled, a realm now available to study with MESA
        due to improved treatments of element diffusion, latent heat release, and
        blending of equations of state. Studies of the final fates of massive stars
        are extended in MESA by our addition of an approximate Riemann solver that
        captures shocks and conserves energy to high accuracy during dynamic epochs.
        We also introduce a 1D capability for modeling the effects of Rayleigh-Taylor
        instabilities that, in combination with the coupling to a public version of

        Type II supernova properties. These capabilities are exhibited with exploratory
        models of pair-instability supernovae, pulsational pair-instability supernovae,
        and the formation of stellar-mass black holes. The applicability of MESA is
        now widened by the capability to import multidimensional hydrodynamic models

        is thought to be wider than the range for single stars, because of the effects

        during and after carbon burning causes the core to cool down so that it avoids

        physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics.
        Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open
        source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications
        in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution
        module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations
        of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass
        to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves
        the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses
        adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports
        shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide
        equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data,
        and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate
        Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate
        independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive
        verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the
        wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary
        tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very
        old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M <SUB>sun</SUB> star from
        the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed
        profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning
        phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase;
        the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the
        complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of
        core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and
        the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star. MESA can be downloaded
        from the project Web site (<A href=\\\"http://mesa.sourceforge.net/\\\">http://mesa.sourceforge.net/</A>).\",\n

        substantially update the capabilities of the open source software package
        Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional

        model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to
        masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology
        enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling
        of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates
        a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented
        when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the
        way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing.
        We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> stars through the end
        of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white
        dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical
        abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare
        thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated
        envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core
        collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray
        burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the
        way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition
        equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational
        speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state,
        opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also
        provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all

        MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating

        the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully
        coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow
        MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct
        supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be
        treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle,

        from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation

        at which a massive star can be fully supported by electron degeneracy. Instead,
        the center evolves to ever higher temperatures, fusing ever heavier elements

        play a crucial role in the collapse and explosion of massive stars, governing
        the infall dynamics of the stellar core, triggering and fueling the explosion
        and driving the cooling and deleptonization of the newly formed neutron star.
        Due to their role neutrinos carry information from the heart of the explosion
        and, due to their weakly interacting nature, offer the only direct probe of
        the dynamics and thermodynamics at the center of a supernova. In this paper,
        we review the present status of modelling the neutrino physics and signal
        formation in collapsing and exploding stars. We assess the capability of current
        and planned large underground neutrino detectors to yield faithful information
        of the time and flavor-dependent neutrino signal from a future Galactic supernova.
        We show how the observable neutrino burst would provide a benchmark for fundamental
        supernova physics with unprecedented richness of detail. Exploiting the treasure
        of the measured neutrino events requires a careful discrimination of source-generated
        properties from signal features that originate on the way to the detector.
        As for the latter, we discuss self-induced flavor conversions associated with
        neutrino-neutrino interactions that occur in the deepest stellar regions;
        matter effects that modify the pattern of flavor conversions in the dynamical
        stellar envelope; neutrino-oscillation signatures that result from structural
        features associated with the shock-wave propagation as well as turbulent mass
        motions in post-shock layers. Finally, we highlight our current understanding

        flavor conversion effects in supernovae and in the early universe. We demonstrate
        that the case of bipolar oscillations, where a dense gas of neutrinos and
        antineutrinos in equal numbers completely converts from one flavor to another
        even if the mixing angle is small, is equivalent to a pendulum in flavor space.
        Bipolar flavor conversion corresponds to the swinging of the pendulum, which
        begins in an unstable upright position (the initial flavor), and passes through
        momentarily the vertically downward position (the other flavor) in the course
        of its motion. The time scale to complete one cycle of oscillation depends
        logarithmically on the vacuum mixing angle. Likewise, the presence of an ordinary
        medium can be shown analytically to contribute to a logarithmic increase in
        the bipolar conversion period. We further find that a more complex (and realistic)
        system of unequal numbers of neutrinos and antineutrinos is analogous to a
        spinning top subject to a torque. This analogy easily explains how such a
        system can oscillate in both the bipolar and the synchronized mode, depending
        on the neutrino density and the size of the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry.
        Our simple model applies strictly only to isotropic neutrino gasses. In more
        general cases, and especially for neutrinos streaming from a supernova core,
        different modes couple to each other with unequal strength, an effect that
        can lead to kinematical decoherence in flavor space rather than collective
        oscillations. The exact circumstances under which collective oscillations

        the effects of these revised rates on the presupernova (post-oxygen burning)
        evolution of massive stars in the mass range 11-40 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. Moreover,
        we include, for the first time in models by our group, the effects of modern
        rates for beta decay in addition to electron capture and positron emission.
        Stars of 15, 25, and 40 M<SUB>solar</SUB> are examined in detail using both
        the full FFN rate set and the revised rates. An additional finely spaced (in
        mass) grid of 34 models is also calculated in order to give the systematics
        of iron core and silicon core masses. Values for the central electron mole
        number at the time of iron core collapse in the new models are typically larger,
        by \u0394Y<SUB>e</SUB>=0.005-0.015, than those of Woosley &amp; Weaver, with
        a tendency for the more massive models to display larger differences. About
        half of this change is a consequence of including beta decay; the other half,
        the result of the smaller rates for electron capture. Unlike what might be
        expected solely on basis of the larger Y<SUB>e</SUB> values, the new iron
        core masses are systematically smaller owing to a decrease in the entropy
        in the outer iron core. The changes in iron core mass range from zero to 0.1
        M<SUB>solar</SUB> (larger changes for high-mass stars). It would be erroneous
        however to estimate the facility of exploding these new models based solely
        upon their iron core mass since the entire core structure is altered and the
        density change is not so different as the adjustments in composition might
        suggest. We also observe, as predicted by Aufderheide et al., a tendency toward
        beta equilibrium just prior to the collapse of the core, and the subsequent
        loss of that equilibrium as core collapse proceeds. This tendency is more
        pronounced in the 15 M<SUB>solar</SUB> model than in the heavier stars. We
        discuss the key weak reaction rates, both beta decay and electron capture,
        responsible for the evolution of Y<SUB>e</SUB> and make suggestions for future
        measurements.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Heger, A.\",\n          \"Woosley,

        weak interaction rates, we have calculated the neutrino spectra arising from
        electron capture on pf-shell nuclei under presupernova conditions. We present
        a simple parametrization of the spectra that allows for an easy implementation
        into collapse simulations. We discuss that the explicit consideration of thermal
        ensembles in the parent nucleus broadens the neutrino spectra and results
        in larger average neutrino energies. The capture rates and neutrino spectra
        can be easily modified to account for phase space blocking by neutrinos, which
        becomes increasingly important during the final stellar collapse.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Langanke,

        neutrinos and antineutrinos produced in the electron-positron annihilation
        processes in hot stellar plasma is presented. Detection of these neutrinos,
        produced copiously in the presupernova, which is an evolutionary advanced
        neutrino-cooled star, may serve in the future as a trigger of a precollapse
        early warning system. Also, observation of neutrinos will probe final stages
        of thermonuclear burning in the presupernova. The spectra obtained with the
        new method are compared to Monte Carlo simulations. To achieve high accuracy
        in the energy range of interest, determined by neutrino detector thresholds,
        a differential cross section for production of the antineutrino, previously
        unknown in an explicit form, is calculated as a function of energy in the
        plasma rest frame. The neutrino spectrum is obtained as a 3-dimensional integral,
        computed with the use of the Cuhre algorithm of at least 5% accuracy. Formulas
        for the mean neutrino energy and its dispersion are given as a combination

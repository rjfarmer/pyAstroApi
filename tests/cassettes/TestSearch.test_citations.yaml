        hydrogen and helium, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen\u2014hereinafter, the CNO
        elements\u2014are the most abundant species in the universe. They are observed
        in all kinds of astrophysical environments, from the smallest to the largest
        scales, and are at the basis of all known forms of life, hence, the constituents
        of any biomarker. As such, their study proves crucial in several areas of
        contemporary astrophysics, extending to astrobiology. In this review, I will
        summarize current knowledge about CNO element evolution in galaxies, starting
        from our home, the Milky Way. After a brief recap of CNO synthesis in stars,
        I will present the comparison between chemical evolution model predictions
        and observations of CNO isotopic abundances and abundance ratios in stars
        and in the gaseous matter. Such a comparison permits to constrain the modes
        and time scales of the assembly of galaxies and their stellar populations,
        as well as stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis theories. I will stress that
        chemical evolution models must be carefully calibrated against the wealth
        of abundance data available for the Milky Way before they can be applied to
        the interpretation of observational datasets for other systems. In this vein,
        I will also discuss the usefulness of some key CNO isotopic ratios as probes
        of the prevailing, galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function in galaxies where
        more direct estimates from the starlight are unfeasible.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Romano,

        \       \"abstract\":\"CONTEXT: The mass loss of He-burning stars, which are
        partially or completely stripped of their outer hydrogen envelope, is a catalyst
        of the cosmic matter cycle and decisive ingredient of massive star evolution.
        Yet, its theoretical fundament is only starting to emerge with major dependencies
        still to be uncovered. AIMS: A temperature or radius dependence is usually
        not included in descriptions for the mass loss of classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR)
        stars, despite being crucial for other hot star wind domains. We thus aim
        to determine whether such a dependency will also be necessary for a comprehensive
        description of mass loss in the cWR regime. METHODS: Sequences of dynamically
        consistent atmosphere models were calculated with the hydrodynamic branch
        of the PoWR code along the temperature domain, using different choices for
        luminosity, mass, and surface abundances. For the first time, we allowed nonmonotonic
        velocity fields when solving the equation of motion. The resulting velocity
        structures were then interpolated for the comoving-frame radiative transfer,
        ensuring that the main wind characteristics were preserved. RESULTS: We find
        a strong dependence of the mass-loss rate with the temperature of the critical/sonic
        point which mainly reflects the different radii and resulting gravitational
        accelerations. Moreover, we obtain a relation between the observed effective
        temperature and the transformed mass-loss rate which seems to be largely independent
        of the underlying stellar parameters. The relation shifts for different clumping
        factors in the outer wind. Below a characteristic value of -4.5, the slope
        of this relation changes and the winds become transparent for He II ionizing
        photons. CONCLUSIONS: The mass loss of cWR stars is a high-dimensional problem
        but also shows inherent scalings which can be used to obtain an approximation
        of the observed effective temperature. (...)\",\n        \"author\":[\"Sander,

        \       \"abstract\":\"The majority of massive stars live in binary or multiple
        systems and will interact with a companion during their lifetimes, which helps
        to explain the observed diversity of core-collapse supernovae. Donor stars
        in binary systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass
        transfer. As a result, not only are the surface properties affected, but so
        is the core structure. However, most calculations of the core-collapse properties
        of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study
        of the difference between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and
        stars of the same initial mass (11-21 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) that have been stripped
        due to stable post-main-sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present
        the pre-supernova core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive
        representation of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies,
        at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain
        an extended gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer remains until
        core collapse and is more extended in mass for higher initial stellar masses.
        It originates from the receding of the convective helium core during core
        helium burning in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star
        models. We find that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences
        in the final density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped
        star models have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment
        of core collapse compared to single-star models, which likely results in systematically
        different supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning
        and oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications
        of our findings for the \\\"explodability\\\", supernova observations, and
        nucleosynthesis of these stars. Our models are publicly available and can
        be readily used as input for detailed supernova simulations.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Laplace,

        trigger explosions of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) to determine their
        nucleosynthesis or ejecta and remnant properties. Recently, their use in spherically
        symmetric (1D) hydrodynamic simulations led to the result that <SUP>56,57</SUP>Ni
        and <SUP>44</SUP>Ti are massively underproduced compared to observational
        estimates for Supernova 1987A, if the explosions are slow, i.e. if the explosion
        mechanism of CCSNe releases the explosion energy on long time-scales. It was
        concluded that rapid explosions are required to match observed abundances,
        i.e. the explosion mechanism must provide the CCSN energy nearly instantaneously
        on time-scales of some ten to order 100 ms. This result, if valid, would disfavour
        the neutrino-heating mechanism, which releases the CCSN energy on time-scales
        of seconds. Here, we demonstrate by 1D hydrodynamic simulations and nucleosynthetic
        post-processing that these conclusions are a consequence of disregarding the
        initial collapse of the stellar core in the thermal-bomb modelling before
        the bomb releases the explosion energy. We demonstrate that the anticorrelation
        of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni yield and energy-injection time-scale vanishes when the
        initial collapse is included and that it can even be reversed, i.e. more <SUP>56</SUP>Ni
        is made by slower explosions, when the collapse proceeds to small radii similar
        to those where neutrino heating takes place in CCSNe. We also show that the
        <SUP>56</SUP>Ni production in thermal-bomb explosions is sensitive to the
        chosen mass cut and that a fixed mass layer or fixed volume for the energy
        deposition cause only secondary differences. Moreover, we propose a most appropriate

        (SNR) G292.0+1.8, a classic example of a core-collapse SNR that contains oxygen-rich
        ejecta, circumstellar material, a rapidly moving pulsar, and a pulsar wind
        nebula (PWN). We use hydrodynamic simulations of the remnant's evolution to
        show that the SNR reverse shock is interacting with the PWN and has most likely
        shocked the majority of the supernova ejecta. In our models, such a scenario
        requires a total ejecta mass of \u22723 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> and implies that
        there is no significant quantity of cold ejecta in the interior of the reverse
        shock. In light of these results, we compare the estimated elemental masses
        and abundance ratios in the reverse-shocked ejecta to nucleosynthesis models,
        and further conclude that they are consistent with a progenitor star with
        an initial mass of 12-16 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>. We conclude that the progenitor
        of G292.0+1.8 was likely a relatively low-mass star that experienced significant
        mass loss through a binary interaction and would have produced a stripped-envelope
        supernova explosion. We also argue that the region known as the \\\"spur\\\"

        and implying a significant natal kick. Finally, we discuss binary mass-loss

        supernovae (SNe Ic), probably arising from the most stripped massive stars,
        remain rare despite their importance. In this paper we present a set of 49
        optical spectra observed with the Las Cumbres Observatory through the Global
        Supernova Project for 6 SNe Ic, including a total of 17 pre-maximum spectra,
        of which 8 are observed more than a week before V-band maximum light. This
        dataset increases the total number of publicly available pre-maximum light
        SN Ic spectra by 25% and we provide publicly available SNID templates that

        hydrogen and helium, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen\u2014hereinafter, the CNO
        elements\u2014are the most abundant species in the universe. They are observed
        in all kinds of astrophysical environments, from the smallest to the largest
        scales, and are at the basis of all known forms of life, hence, the constituents
        of any biomarker. As such, their study proves crucial in several areas of
        contemporary astrophysics, extending to astrobiology. In this review, I will
        summarize current knowledge about CNO element evolution in galaxies, starting
        from our home, the Milky Way. After a brief recap of CNO synthesis in stars,
        I will present the comparison between chemical evolution model predictions
        and observations of CNO isotopic abundances and abundance ratios in stars
        and in the gaseous matter. Such a comparison permits to constrain the modes
        and time scales of the assembly of galaxies and their stellar populations,
        as well as stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis theories. I will stress that
        chemical evolution models must be carefully calibrated against the wealth
        of abundance data available for the Milky Way before they can be applied to
        the interpretation of observational datasets for other systems. In this vein,
        I will also discuss the usefulness of some key CNO isotopic ratios as probes
        of the prevailing, galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function in galaxies where
        more direct estimates from the starlight are unfeasible.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Romano,

        \       \"abstract\":\"The majority of massive stars live in binary or multiple
        systems and will interact with a companion during their lifetimes, which helps
        to explain the observed diversity of core-collapse supernovae. Donor stars
        in binary systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass
        transfer. As a result, not only are the surface properties affected, but so
        is the core structure. However, most calculations of the core-collapse properties
        of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study
        of the difference between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and
        stars of the same initial mass (11-21 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) that have been stripped
        due to stable post-main-sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present
        the pre-supernova core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive
        representation of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies,
        at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain
        an extended gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer remains until
        core collapse and is more extended in mass for higher initial stellar masses.
        It originates from the receding of the convective helium core during core
        helium burning in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star
        models. We find that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences
        in the final density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped
        star models have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment
        of core collapse compared to single-star models, which likely results in systematically
        different supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning
        and oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications
        of our findings for the \\\"explodability\\\", supernova observations, and
        nucleosynthesis of these stars. Our models are publicly available and can
        be readily used as input for detailed supernova simulations.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Laplace,

        (SNR) G292.0+1.8, a classic example of a core-collapse SNR that contains oxygen-rich
        ejecta, circumstellar material, a rapidly moving pulsar, and a pulsar wind
        nebula (PWN). We use hydrodynamic simulations of the remnant's evolution to
        show that the SNR reverse shock is interacting with the PWN and has most likely
        shocked the majority of the supernova ejecta. In our models, such a scenario
        requires a total ejecta mass of \u22723 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> and implies that
        there is no significant quantity of cold ejecta in the interior of the reverse
        shock. In light of these results, we compare the estimated elemental masses
        and abundance ratios in the reverse-shocked ejecta to nucleosynthesis models,
        and further conclude that they are consistent with a progenitor star with
        an initial mass of 12-16 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>. We conclude that the progenitor
        of G292.0+1.8 was likely a relatively low-mass star that experienced significant
        mass loss through a binary interaction and would have produced a stripped-envelope
        supernova explosion. We also argue that the region known as the \\\"spur\\\"
        in G292.0+1.8 arises as a result of the pulsar's motion through the supernova
        ejecta, and that its dynamical properties may suggest a line-of-sight component
        to the pulsar's velocity, leading to a total space velocity of ~600 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>
        and implying a significant natal kick. Finally, we discuss binary mass-loss

        widely used method to artificially trigger explosions of core-collapse supernovae
        (CCSNe) to determine their nucleosynthesis or ejecta and remnant properties.
        Recently, their use in spherically symmetric (1D) hydrodynamic simulations
        led to the result that <SUP>56, 57</SUP>Ni and <SUP>44</SUP>Ti are massively
        underproduced compared to observational estimates for Supernova 1987A, if
        the explosions are slow, i.e., if the explosion mechanism of CCSNe releases
        the explosion energy on long timescales. It was concluded that rapid explosions
        are required to match observed abundances, i.e., the explosion mechanism must
        provide the CCSN energy nearly instantaneously on timescales of some ten to
        order 100 ms. This result, if valid, would disfavor the neutrino-heating mechanism,
        which releases the CCSN energy on timescales of seconds. Here, we demonstrate
        by 1D hydrodynamic simulations and nucleosynthetic post-processing that these
        conclusions are a consequence of disregarding the initial collapse of the
        stellar core in the thermal-bomb modelling before the bomb releases the explosion
        energy. We demonstrate that the anti-correlation of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni yield
        and energy-injection timescale vanishes when the initial collapse is included
        and that it can even be reversed, i.e., more <SUP>56</SUP>Ni is made by slower
        explosions, when the collapse proceeds to small radii similar to those where
        neutrino heating takes place in CCSNe. We also show that the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni
        production in thermal-bomb explosions is sensitive to the chosen mass cut
        and that a fixed mass layer or fixed volume for the energy deposition cause
        only secondary differences. Moreover, we propose a most appropriate setup

        the advent of high cadence, all-sky automated surveys, supernovae (SNe) are
        now discovered closer than ever to their dates of explosion. However, young
        pre-maximum light follow-up spectra of Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic), probably
        arising from the most stripped massive stars, remain rare despite their importance.
        In this paper we present a set of 49 optical spectra observed with the Las
        Cumbres Observatory through the Global Supernova Project for 6 SNe Ic, including
        a total of 17 pre-maximum spectra, of which 8 are observed more than a week
        before V-band maximum light. This dataset increases the total number of publicly
        available pre-maximum light SN Ic spectra by 25% and we provide publicly available
        SNID templates that will significantly aid in the fast identification of young
        SNe Ic in the future. We present detailed analysis of these spectra, including
        Fe II 5169 velocity measurements, O I 7774 line strengths, and continuum shapes.

        in X-rays or as gravitational wave sources is steadily increasing, the known
        population remains orders of magnitude smaller than predicted by stellar evolution
        theory. A significant fraction of stellar-mass black holes is expected to

        Although a handful of such quiescent black hole candidates have been proposed,
        the majority have been challenged by follow-up investigations. A confusion
        that emerged recently concerns binary systems that appear to contain a normal
        B-type star with an unseen companion, believed to be a black hole. On closer

        be stars stripped of most of their mass through an interaction with their
        binary companion, which in at least two cases is a rapidly rotating star rather

        majority of massive stars live in binary or multiple systems and will interact
        with a companion during their lifetimes, which helps to explain the observed
        diversity of core-collapse supernovae. Donor stars in binary systems can lose
        most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass transfer. As a result,
        not only are the surface properties affected, but so is the core structure.
        However, most calculations of the core-collapse properties of massive stars
        rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study of the difference
        between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and stars of the same
        initial mass (11-21 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) that have been stripped due to stable
        post-main-sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present the pre-supernova
        core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive representation
        of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies, at the edge of
        the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain an extended
        gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer remains until core collapse
        and is more extended in mass for higher initial stellar masses. It originates
        from the receding of the convective helium core during core helium burning
        in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star models. We find
        that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences in the final
        density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped star models
        have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment of core collapse
        compared to single-star models, which likely results in systematically different
        supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning and oxygen-rich
        layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications of our
        findings for the \\\"explodability\\\", supernova observations, and nucleosynthesis
        of these stars. Our models are publicly available and can be readily used
        as input for detailed supernova simulations.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Laplace,

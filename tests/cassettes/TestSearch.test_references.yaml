        broad range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments in Stellar
        Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe
        libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics.
        A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the
        numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution
        scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced
        evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition
        equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated
        timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP.
        State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction
        rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module
        is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined
        public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples
        indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed
        and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These
        examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs,
        and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of
        a 1 M <SUB>sun</SUB> star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white
        dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars
        through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning
        asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating
        B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars
        from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing
        Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron
        star. MESA can be downloaded from the project Web site (<A href=\\\"http://mesa.sourceforge.net/\\\">http://mesa.sourceforge.net/</A>).\",\n

        in MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends
        its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The
        dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler
        and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation
        code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux
        criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at
        non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates
        semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M
        <SUB>\u2299</SUB> stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He

        of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We
        introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the
        uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the
        generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability
        progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves
        the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show
        how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core
        processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear
        reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We

        MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating
        stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing
        the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully
        coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow
        MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct
        supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be
        treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle,
        from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis
        from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation
        instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips
        for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology
        data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and
        robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction
        rates \u201Con-the-fly\u201D from input nuclear data allows better simulation
        of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some
        massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the
        strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now
        allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot
        stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit
        consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound
        enabling capability for accelerating MESA's development.\",\n        \"author\":[\"Paxton,

        supernova explosions are calculated. In each case nucleosynthesis has already
        been determined for 200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the presupernova
        star, including the effects of time dependent convection. Here each star is
        exploded using a piston to give a specified final kinetic energy at infinity
        (typically 1.2 \xD7 10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs), and the explosive modifications
        to the nucleosynthesis, including the effects of neutrino irradiation, determined.

        The synthesis of each isotope is discussed along with its sensitivity to model

        determined and often found not to correspond to the location of the piston
        (typically the edge of the iron core), but to a \\\"mass cut\\\" farther out.
        This mass cut is sensitive not only to the explosion energy, but also to the
        presupernova structure, stellar mass, and the metallicity. Unless the explosion
        mechanism, for unknown reasons, provides a much larger characteristic energy

        will experience considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the initial
        launch of a successful shock. While such explosions will produce a viable,
        bright Type II supernova light curve, lacking perhaps the radioactive tail,
        they will have dramatically reduced yields of heavy elements and may leave
        black hole remnants of up to 10 and more solar masses. The production of black
        holes may be particularly favored for stars of low metallicity, both because
